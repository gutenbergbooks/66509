<h3 class="main">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A few fairly typical Algonquin myths relating the exploits of Wiske·djak were taken
down in the summer of 1913 from Benjamin Mackenzie of the Timiskaming band. He had
learned them when a young man from Algonquins near Dumoine lake<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1124src" href="#xd31e1124">1</a> at the head of Dumoine river. These versions are also current at Timiskaming, as
I found by testing a few incidents with other informants, who, however, knew only
of fragments. These myths also are not considered entirely complete.
</p>
<p>The trickster-transformer Wiske·djak “meat bird” is the personified Canada Jay or
“Whisky Jack” (Perisoreus sp.). He is not in the least altruistic, though he seems
to have in mind some provision for the Indians, as appears more particularly in story
number 4. For the most part his transformations are semi-accidental. It seems hardly
worth while at the present time to comment in detail on the transformer concept here,
as it is my intention to pursue investigations further in this general <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>area, in which the transformer appears under various titles. At Timagami, for instance,
he is called Nenebuc or <i lang="oj">wi·ske·′</i>; at Mattagami, he is We·′micuze·‵hwa or Nenebuc. The name Wiske·djak and its variants
seem to be more or less characteristic of the Algonquin bands, in which respect they
resemble the Cree.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1137src" href="#xd31e1137">2</a> A secondary hero personage here is Ci′ŋgəbis, the Horned Grebe (<i lang="la">Colymbus auritus</i>).
</p>
<p>It is important to note, in dealing with myths in this area, that the scenes of the
trickster-transformer’s adventures always lay in well known localities within the
territory of the band among which the story is told. These vary considerably, so that
the stories have to be gathered independently from each band before any thorough comparison
can be attempted. In these myths the scene of action commences with Dumoine lake,
<i lang="oj">Ki·we·′goma</i> “Turn-back lake.” The other geographical references are as follows. The beaver’s
cabin in the first story is a high round-topped mountain near the lake. Then came
Coulonge river and Pembroke lakes. The Calumet chutes are below Allumette island in
Ottawa river; they are called <i lang="oj">Apwa′ganiba‵utək</i> “Pipe rapids,” because the stone at that place is suitable for making pipes and was
there sought by the Indians for this purpose. The big river referred to is Ottawa
river, <i lang="oj">Ki′tcisi·′bi</i> “big river,” down which Wiske·djak’s course seems to have been. Other general qualities
of the transformer attributed to him by the Indians were given by the informant and
appear at the end of the cycle.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(1)</span> <i>Wiske·djak Pursues the Beaver.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Wiske·djak was travelling about looking for adventures. He never succeeded in anything
he tried to do. He never did well and was always hungry. In his travels he came to
<i lang="oj">Ki·we·′goma</i> “Turn-back lake” (Dumoine lake). Now he even had no canoe, but he was a great swimmer.
When he came to <i lang="oj">Ki·we·′goma</i>, he found it even too big to swim, so he started to <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>walk around it. He wanted to hunt beaver. On one side of the lake, he came to a round,
high mountain that looked like a beaver-lodge. In front of it he found deep water,
just as there is in front of a beaver lodge. And a little way off shore was a little
island with many grasses; just as the beaver provides a winter supply of greens for
himself near his lodge, so this island he supposed to be the beaver’s winter supply
and the mountain his lodge. Wiske·djak wanted to get this great beaver, but did not
know how to get at him. Then he thought of draining the lake, so he went way around
to the lower end and broke away the dam so that the water would run off. Soon the
water began to go, and Wiske·djak lingered about, waiting for it to get low enough
to get at the beaver. Pretty soon he took a nap. When he woke up, it was rather late
and he hurried back to the mountain only to find that the beaver had gone. Now he
thought the beaver might have escaped over the dam with the water, so he started back,
and sure enough he saw the beaver going over the dam. “Now,” said he, “I lost my beaver.”
He followed hard after him and had lots of trouble to keep up.
</p>
<p>He followed him past Coulonge river and Pembroke lakes. But when the beaver reached
Calumet chutes, he was afraid to go through and took to the portage. Then Wiske·djak
saw him and chased him harder over the portage. When he got to the lower end, he lost
sight of the beaver and started back up river (Ottawa river). When he got to the upper
end of the portage, he saw fresh tracks. “Well,” said he, “there has been somebody
here. I wonder if I could trace him. We might have something to eat.” Then he followed
the track to the lower end of the portage where he had already been, but nobody was
there. So he went back to the upper end of the portage and there saw more fresh tracks
leading to the lower end. These he followed to where he had been twice before, but
saw no beaver. He then discovered that they were his own tracks he had been following
and gave it up. The tracks back and forth can be seen plainly to-day imprinted in
the stone of Calumet portage, which the Indians call Wiske·djak tracks. After this
he started off on another trip.

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(2)</span> <i>Wiske·djak Kills the Bear and Gets his Head Fastened in the Skull.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Wiske·djak was always in trouble. One time he was going along the shore of a big lake
carrying a big pail. He felt very hungry and was looking for something to eat. Pretty
soon he saw a lot of clumps of high-bush cranberries and commenced to eat from one
little clump to another. Then he remembered his pail. Said he, “If I could pick my
pail full, I would have a good supply to last me a long while.” So he began filling
his pail, and as he went on he got into some big clumps. Suddenly he saw a big Bear
sitting down among some bushes, every little while rubbing his eyes and picking out
his paws as though something was hurting his eyes. Wiske·djak watched him a while
and thought how nice it would be to kill him. What a big supply of food he would have
then to fill his pail with! So he went up to the bear and said, “Hello, Bear! What’s
the matter with you?” The Bear answered, “Oh! my eyes are so sore, and I can’t see
where to go. I just wish somebody would help me.” “Well, come along with me. I will
help you. I know where to get some fine medicine that will fix you up all right.”
“Very well,” said the bear.
</p>
<p>Wiske·djak led him off to a big bunch of cranberries. There he gathered a lot of berries
and crushed them in his hands. Then he told the Bear to open his eyes so that he could
put the medicine on. “It may hurt you when I put this medicine in, but it will cure
you, so don’t mind it.” Then Wiske·djak began to rub the cranberry juice into the
Bear’s eyes. The Bear began to roar and tear around with the pain, making a great
time. “But never mind,” said Wiske·djak. “It may hurt, but it will cure you.” In the
meantime he hunted around and got two big stones, and while the Bear was blinded with
the pain, began pounding him on the head with the stones. He had a hard fight all
over the berry-patch, but finally succeeded and killed the Bear. Then Wiske·djak went
back to where he had left his pail and got his knife. He skinned the bear and cut
him up. He put some of the pieces into his pail to make a bouillon. Then he got sticks
and made a fire for the cooking. Next he got some birch bark peeled off and cleaned
a big space <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>near the fire, spreading the birch bark to put the meat on. He stuck the pieces of
meat on sharp sticks. When they were well roasted, he spread them on the bark to cool
off before eating them. He left the bear’s head for the last, then he began to eat
lots of the bear’s fat and the meat. He had a great big pile of it. He sat down to
enjoy his meal.
</p>
<p>Now, just as he was ready to begin, the wind began to blow a little, and at the same
time from above came a little cry, “Whun!” He looked around, because it bothered him,
but could not see anything, so he started to eat again. Then the same little cry sounded
again, “Whun!” and he stopped to look around, but couldn’t see anything. The third
time he started to eat, the same cry sounded, and then he got up and hunted for the
cause, for it bothered him and was spoiling his good time. When he looked up, he saw
a tree that had been blown down, resting in the crotch of another tree over him that
rubbed when the wind blew and made this noise. Said Wiske·djak, “You had better stop
that noise until I get through eating. I don’t like it at all.” “Oh!” said the tree,
“I have to do it. I can’t stop it.” Whenever Wiske·djak started to eat again, the
wind blew a little. Then Wiske·djak climbed the tree and put his hands in between
the tree and the crotch to stop the rubbing, and when the wind blew a little the space
spread and closed again. It pinned his hands in the crotch and held him fast. “Let
me go! Let me go!” he begged of the tree. “I must get down to my meat.” But the only
answer he got was, “No,” and there he stayed.
</p>
<p>Pretty soon when he looked down, he saw a Squirrel come and take some of his meat.
He shouted for him to go away without any success. Next came the Marten, then the
Fisher, then some Wildcats, then Ravens, and in fact all kinds of animals came and
began to eat up his supply of meat. He tried to drive them away, but couldn’t. The
more he shouted at them, the more they danced and sang and ran off mocking him. They
carried away all his pieces of meat to their dens, but didn’t touch the pail of grease.
By the time all the meat was gone, a little breeze arose and the tree let him go.
When he got down, all was cleared away. There were not even bones enough for <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>bouillon. There was only the grease in the pail. “Well,” said he, “I’ll have grease
anyway.”
</p>
<p>The Bear’s bladder was hanging in some willow trees where he had thrown it when he
had cut him up. And he went over and filled the bladder with the grease, so that he
could cool it. He tied the neck of the bladder so that it would hold the grease. “Now,”
said he to himself, “even if they have taken all my meat and bones, I’ll have the
grease. I’ll just tie it by a string to a stick and let it float in the river until
it is cool, and then I’ll make a good meal of that anyway.” So he tied the bladder
of grease to a stick and let it swing in the current of the river to cool it. A Muskrat
came along. “Kwe, Muskrat! Where are you going?” said Wiske·djak. “Oh! anywhere,”
answered the Muskrat. “Well, then, come work for me,” said Wiske·djak. “Come, tie
this bladder on your tail and swim further out in the deep water where it is cold
and cool it for me. Don’t swim too fast and go easy or you might break the bladder
and spill my grease.” “All right,” said the Muskrat, “I will do it for you and you
will tell me how fast to go.” Then Wiske·djak tied it to his tail and the Muskrat
started off with it. He made a plan meanwhile. The Muskrat swam way out. “Hold on,”
said Wiske·djak, “you’re going too fast.” But the Muskrat swam farther and when he
got far enough, he snapped the string with his tail, broke the bladder, and dove out
of sight. The grease spread all over the water. Wiske·djak cried and ran out into
the water and tried to scoop up the grease in his hands to save some of it, but it
all escaped him.
</p>
<p>When he had lost his grease, he thought of his bouillon, and went back to his pail,
but when he got there, he found that the Wolverine had come and eaten it all up. Then
he searched about to see if he could even find a small bone. There was not a thing
left. After a while he saw a string of little ants going back and forth from under
a log. “I wonder what they are doing,” thought he. “Maybe they have something hidden
under there.” He followed them and looked under the log, and there were the ants eating
away on the Bear’s skull, devouring the brains. “If I could get in there myself, I
could get some of those brains,” said he. He tried different ways to reach in, but
could not get at it. “If I could only put my head in <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>that hole, I could eat some. I wish my head was as small as a snake’s head, then I
could get it in.” Then his head began to get small like a snake’s head and he poked
it inside the skull and began eating a great snack. He licked the skull clean and
said, “Well, I had a meal. Now, if I could only get up and out, I would be all right.”
But when he tried to get his head clear of the skull, he could not, because his head
had turned back to its original size and was fast inside the skull. He couldn’t see
where he was going.
</p>
<p>Then he sat down on a log, thinking what to do next. “If I knock my head against a
rock, I might break my own head.” Then he thought of the Indians and started off in
search of a camp to get help. He was blinded by the skull and could not see where
he was going. Soon he banged against a tree. “What’s your name?” he asked of the tree.
“Maple,” was the answer. “Well, I’m in high ground. I won’t find any people camping
way up here.” Soon he banged against another tree. <span class="corr" id="xd31e1202" title="Not in source">“</span>What’s your name?” he asked. “Beech,” was the answer. “I’m still in high ground,”
said he; “I must strike lower ground.” Soon he banged against another tree and asked
its name. It answered, “White-pine.” “Still in high ground,” said he, “but getting
lower.” The next tree he bumped against proved to be a red pine. “Still in high ground.
No Indian camp here.” At last he banged against a balsam and then a spruce. “I am
getting on low ground now,” said he. Pretty soon he got into ragged bush and struck
a rough-bark tree. “What’s your name?” he asked. “Cedar,” said the tree. “Aha! Now
I’m in low ground and may strike a camp at last.” He went on and soon got into very
tight bush and struck an alder. “Aha! Now, I am close to a lake. I will soon find
a camp.” Next he got tangled up in knee-high twigs. He asked them what their name
was and they told him willows. He said, “Am I near a lake?” “Yes,” they answered.
“Can you see people?” “Yes, up at yonder point there is a camp,” they answered. “Is
it far?” he asked. “No, not far,” said they. So he went on and got into something
still lower. “What’s your name?” he asked. “Grass,” was the answer. Now he walked
on and got into water, deeper and deeper. “If the people would only see me, I would
be all right,” said he. Next he started to swim. <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>He splashed about and made a noise to attract the people if any were about. Suddenly
he remembered about the skull on his head and said, “If the people see me, they might
think that I’m a bear and try to kill me.” So he swam on.
</p>
<p>Sure enough the Indians saw him. They recognized Wiske·djak by his antics and thought
he was trying to play some trick on them, so they laughed about it and quietly paddled
up close to him. They pretended they thought he was a bear and made out as though
they were going to kill him. Wiske·djak swam as hard as he could for his life. “Hand
me my axe,” said one of the Indians, “till I kill him.” “Stand aside till I shoot
him with my arrow,” said another.<span id="xd31e1208"></span> “Hurry up, paddle hard or we’ll lose him,” said a third. They all kept shouting and
making a great pretence to get after him, all the time laughing at Wiske·djak and
splashing with their paddles as though trying to keep up with him. Wiske·djak all
the time struggled ahead in great fear, expecting any moment to be killed. At last
he got across the lake on the other shore and his feet struck bottom. He landed on
a flat rock with the Indians behind him. Suddenly he slipped and fell on his head.
The bear skull cracked and fell off and left his head free. Then he saw the Indians.
“Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!<span class="corr" id="xd31e1210" title="Not in source">”</span> cried he. “I’m Wiske·djak.” Then he took to the bush and escaped.

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(3)</span> <i>Wiske·djak Invites the Ducks to a Dance.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Wiske·djak was always hungry. One time, in the autumn of the year, he noticed the
flocks of ducks flying south and how fat they were. Then he made up his mind to try
and get some for a good supply against the winter. He decided to make a big dance
among the birds in the autumn and to invite all the ducks and geese to come, so that
he could kill them. Then he set to work and built a big wigwam and cleaned a nice
place around the outside. He built a little fire in the middle of the wigwam and fixed
a nice space all around it for the dance to take place. Then he made his door of birch
bark, so that the centre stick, which keeps the bark spread, extended over the ends
of the bark and kept it from opening inwards. Now, everything was about ready, so
he went to see a Duck and said to him, “Soon, <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>now, you will be going away south to be gone all winter and not to come back until
next spring. It will be a long time before I will see you again, so I want to get
up a dance for you all. You go and invite all your friends—the Ducks, the Geese and
the others who go south.” “All right,” said the Duck.
</p>
<p>So he got ready and went back to his wigwam to wait for the company. To help invite
the birds, he sat down in front of it and got his drum and rattle and began singing
a song of invitation.
</p>
<p>As the ducks came flying by overhead, they heard his song and came down to join the
party. He sang his song and told them, “You are going away to be gone until next spring,
and I won’t see you for a long time, so I want to get up a dance for you all, before
you go.” A lot of them came down and he gathered a crowd outside. Then he said, “Now,
let us go inside and have our good time,” and he opened the door and they all went
in. Then he fixed the small fire in the middle so that it would just give enough light
to see a little. “Now,” said he, “you must obey the rule of this dance and do whatever
you are told when you hear the order.” He sat down on one side of the fire near the
door and they all began dancing around. They got well mixed up before long—the geese,
ducks, loons, and all kinds of birds, and Ciŋgəbis<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1225src" href="#xd31e1225">3</a> was there too. When he got them warmed up to the dance, they all got mixed up and
soon Wiske·djak said, “Now, you must all close your eyes and not open them until I
give the word.” Then they obeyed and kept on dancing with their eyes closed. Then,
while their eyes were closed, Wiske·djak got up and began wringing the neck of one
after another. The noise of the dancing prevented them from hearing what he was doing.
</p>
<p>Pretty soon, Ciŋgəbis began to suspect that Wiske·djak was moving around, so he danced
over into a dark corner where Wiske·djak could not see him and opened one of his eyes
a little to peep out. There he saw Wiske·djak going among the dancers, wringing their
necks, and he called out, “Wiske·djak is killing you! Fly!” Then they opened their
eyes and saw what was happening and took wing and flew away. But little <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>Ciŋgəbis was way up in the corner. When the birds rushed for the door, Ciŋgəbis got
there last. Wiske·djak jumped at him and gave him a kick behind that knocked him out
of shape. Then he kicked him out of the door and cried, “Now go, you little rascal.”
Ciŋgəbis flew off. Ever since then he has been out of shape. His feet are so far back
that he cannot walk on land. Wiske·djak did not eat the ducks he had killed after
all. He was a curious lad, that Wiske·djak. (I wasn’t with him any longer. I left
him there.)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1232src" href="#xd31e1232">4</a>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(4)</span> <i>Wiske·djak <span lang="la">Anum Suum Urit</span> and Originates Rock-weed and Red Willow from the Scabs.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now Wiske·djak went on after he had kicked Ciŋgəbis. He saw the flocks of birds rising
in the sky and flying overhead for the south to where it is warmer. When he lost sight
of them, he went back into his wigwam and looked over what birds he had killed. He
wondered how he could cook them best, so they would taste good. Then he made up his
mind to build a big fire outside his wigwam. When he got the fire well started, he
got a stick and sharpened its point; then with this he loosened up the ground all
around and under the fire. When the fire burned down, it left the sand red hot round
about, and the holes too. Then, where the holes were, he stuck the fowl head-first
with their feathers all on just as he had killed them, leaving their feet sticking
out above the ground. Then he put on more fire to roast them well in the hot sand.
He stayed up part of the night tending his fire, until he grew drowsy. “Now,” said
he, “I’ll take a little sleep while my birds are cooking in the sand.” But he grew
uneasy lest somebody might come while he was sleeping and steal his birds. Now Wiske·djak
had the power to make anything answer him when he spoke to it, no matter what it might
be. So he decided to lie down in a clear space facing the lake where people would
come in a canoe if any were around. He lay down <span lang="la">ano suo lacui adverso</span>, resting on his knees and elbows. “Now,” declared he, “I’m going to have a little
sleep. You watch and tell me when you see any <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>Indians, if they should come in a canoe. Wake me up if you see anybody.” So he went
to sleep. After a while <span lang="la">anus ejus clamavit</span>, saying that an Indian was coming. Wiske·djak jumped up and looked around everywhere,
but could not see anybody. So he lay down again and <span lang="la">ano suo idem dixit ut antea</span>. But just as he was going to sleep, <span lang="la">anus iterum clamavit</span>, saying that a canoe was approaching from around the point. Wiske·djak jumped up
again and looked all around, but he could not see any canoe. He then grew angry and
<span lang="la">anum suum vehementes objurgavit</span> and warned it not to tell any more lies, as he wanted to go to sleep. Then he lay
down and fell asleep again.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Now this time there were some Indians coming around the point in a canoe and they
saw the smoke from Wiske·djak’s fire on the shore of the lake. Seeing something strange-looking
near the fire—they could not well make out what—they paddled near. As they drifted
quietly in shore, looking sharp to see what curious creature it might be, they came
quite close. One of the Indians said, “Look out, it might be Wiske·djak up to some
more of his mischief.” So one of the men went ashore and said, “I’ll go see who it
is and what he is doing.” Then he went up the shore to where Wiske·djak was crouching
asleep and looked at him. He then found out who it was, Wiske·djak, and saw the fire
burning, but couldn’t see anything cooking. But at last he examined the fire-place
and saw the fowls’ legs sticking out of the sand around the fire. He stepped closer
to the fire and saw that they were the legs of all kinds of ducks and geese. Then
he went down to the water and told the rest of the men what he had found. Said they,
“We will all go up and take Wiske·djak’s ducks and geese out of the sand and play
a trick on him.” So they got out of the canoe and took their paddles. They dug up
all the fowl with the paddles and twisted the legs off them. The legs they stuck back
in the sand just as Wiske·djak had placed them. They then took the ducks and geese
and started off as fast as possible before Wiske·djak should wake up and see them.
</p>
<p>Pretty soon Wiske·djak did wake up, as he had slept enough. He got up and looked about.
Nobody was around and things <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>looked quiet. “I guess my food is pretty well cooked by this time,” said he. Then
he pulled up one of the duck legs from the sand, and ate the meat on the shank. He
went all around pulling the fowls’ legs out of the sand and eating them. “They are
very well done to pull off so easily. Oh, they must be nice and tender!” thought he.
The only thing he noticed was that the legs came very freely from the sand. “They
must be very well cooked to come out of the sand so freely.” He took a digging stick
and commenced to dig them out. He commenced shovelling away the sand where one of
his ducks was, but found the hole empty, and he dug all around in the sand but found
they were all taken away. He could not find one bird. At last he got tired of searching
and then <span lang="la">ano suo dixit</span>, “So I thought I left you to watch for me while I was asleep!” <span lang="la">Et anus <a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1277src" href="#xd31e1277">5</a>respondit</span>, “When I was watching for you and woke you up, you were not satisfied. You gave me
a scolding. So when the Indians did come, I thought I would leave you to do your own
watching.”
</p>
<p>Then Wiske·djak grew angry and planned <span lang="la">anum suum castigare</span>. He got wood and made another big fire. He got it burning well until there were a
lot of red coals. “Now,<span class="corr" id="xd31e1286" title="Not in source">”</span> <span lang="la">ano suo dixit</span>, “I’ll give you a little punishment for letting my ducks and geese go to the Indians.”
He went over to the fire and straddled his legs over the fire-place, sitting over
the red coals. <span lang="la">Anum suum paulum urere incepit ut eum castigaret</span>, but he stood the pain the fire gave him. Soon his flesh commenced sizzling, making
a sputtering noise “Tsii!” as it roasted nicely. He heard it squealing. “You can squeal
all you like till you get enough of a scorching,” <span lang="la">ano suo dixit</span> Wiske·djak. When he thought it was burnt enough, he got up and started walking off.
He started off to look for something else to do, <span lang="la">ano suo maxime dolente</span>.
</p>
<p>He wandered across swamps and mountains and around lakes, suffering with his burns.
All at once he came upon a little flock of partridges newly hatched, and their mother
was away. “Kwe!” said Wiske·djak, “What are you doing here?” “Nothing,” said the little
Partridges, “just staying here.” “Where is your mother?” asked Wiske·djak. “Away hunting,”
replied they. “What’s your name?” he asked of one. Each <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>little Partridge told him its name until he came to the last, the youngest one. “What’s
your name?” he demanded. “Kuckuŋge·′sįs, suddenly frightened!” answered the little
Partridge. “Oh you!” said Wiske·djak, “what can you frighten?” Then he took a lump
of soft mud and threw it over all the young Partridges, so that he almost covered
them with the dirty mud. “What can you frighten now?” said he. Then he left and walked
along until he came to a high mountain. He was getting very sore from his burns and
<span lang="la">anus <a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1307src" href="#xd31e1307">6</a>maxime doluit</span>. When he climbed to the top of the mountain he found a nice breeze blowing across
it. He found a high rock swept by the cooling breeze. “Now,” thought he to himself,
“if I can find a nice place on the highest of these rocks I can rest myself and let
the cool breeze cool my burns.” So he searched around the mountain until he came to
a place clear of trees where there was a great chasm below, hundreds of feet deep,
with a nice cool breeze coming over. Here he lay down right on the edge where most
of the breeze was. He found the wind very good. He got relief from his suffering burns.
His pains had been so bad and he had walked so far that he was very tired and sleepy.
Soon he was fast asleep on the brink of the cliff.
</p>
<p>By this time the old Partridge had got home to his young and found them all covered
with black mud. The old Partridge said to his young, “What has happened to you? Where
did you go? Anywhere?” “No,” they answered, “nowhere.” “Well, what did this?” he asked.
“Well, Wiske·djak came along to-day after you went away. He commenced asking us questions
and we answered him as well as we could. He asked us our names and we all told him.
But one, our youngest brother, was the last to be asked, and when he told his name
Wiske·djak got angry and said, ‘What could you frighten?’ Then he got mud and threw
it over us and left us in this mess.” So the old Partridge was angry. He cleaned the
young ones up, washed and dried them, and gave them their food which he had brought
back for them. Then he asked them which way Wiske·djak went and they showed him the
direction. Then the old Partridge took the trail the little ones showed him and followed
Wiske·djak across the swamps, over the mountains, and around the lakes. He tracked
him to the big high mountains. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>kept on until he reached the high rock of the cliff, and there he saw Wiske·djak lying
on the edge of the rock sleeping soundly. The old Partridge went alongside of him
on the upper side of the rock, above him. He spread his wings and went right up close
to Wiske·djak’s ears, and shouted, screeched, and clapped his wings. Wiske·djak woke
up with a start and jumped up. He saw something above him making a terrible noise
and took such a fright that he fell over the edge of the rock. “Now,” said the old
Partridge, “you will know better what <i lang="oj">Kuckuŋge·′sįs</i> is now.”
</p>
<p>So poor Wiske·djak tumbled down the cliff, banging and sliding on his hind-quarters,
and scraped all the scabs off his burns. When he fell to the bottom of the rocky cliff,
he lay stunned for some time, but after a while he arose. He started to crawl away
on his hands and knees. Soon he saw a lake at the bottom of the cliff. His sores pained
him very badly. Thought he to himself, “There’s a nice lake; now I’ll go down there
and cool myself in the water.” He started crawling toward the shore. Before he came
to the edge of the water there were a lot of low willows he had to crawl through.
As he went over them, he looked back where he had come and saw all his blood from
the sores stuck on to the willow twigs. Then said he, “Now you young willows will
be called ‘red willows’ from this time on. And when the Indians get short of tobacco
they will cut you and scrape the bark off you and dry you and use you to smoke for
their tobacco.” He looked up higher toward the rocks where he fell down. There he
saw his scabs sticking to the rocks where he had stuck, some large, some small. Said
he to the rocks, “You will hold on to these scabs. Don’t ever let go. And when the
Indians are hard put to it for something to eat, you will give them some of my scabs
and tell them to wash them in cold water and boil them with rabbit meat or any kind
of meat or fish. It will furnish them with fine soup, those small ones. And now the
biggest scabs—you can tell them that if they have any kind of oil they can oil them
a little and roast them before the fire and that it will give them good nourishment
when they are hard put to it for something to eat.” So from that time the Indians
have used red willow bark to smoke and the “rock weed” to eat when they have needed
<span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>them.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1322src" href="#xd31e1322">7</a> By this time <span lang="la">anus Wiske·djaki magnopere doluit</span> and he thought he would go into the water for a while and cool his burns.
</p>
<p>So I had some travelling to do and I left him there, and I don’t know where he went.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(<i>5</i>)</span> <i>Wiske·djak Disguises himself as a Lynx.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One time in winter Wiske·djak was going along and fell upon an Indian’s trail. He
followed the tracks of the snowshoes and soon came to a place where the Indian had
set his rabbit snares. Wiske·djak saw the rabbits in the snares. He followed on and
finally came to where a Lynx was caught in a snare. He thought it was a very curious
looking creature. The Lynx’s eyes were bulging out from being choked in the snare,
and his teeth showed. Now Wiske·djak admired the Lynx’s bulging eyes. “Don’t you think
your eyes are very pretty?” he asked the Lynx. “No, not very,” answered the Lynx,
because every thing living or dead had to reply when Wiske·djak asked it a question.
Wiske·djak was very eager to get pretty eyes like the Lynx’s, so he made a fire and
roasted the poor Lynx to get its skin off. Then Wiske·djak took out his own eyes and
pulled the Lynx’s skin on over his own head, so that the bulging eyes of the Lynx
fitted into his own eye sockets.
</p>
<p>Then Wiske·djak went on his travels, very well pleased with his looks. But he found
out that with the Lynx’s eyes he could only see well at night. So after a while he
became dissatisfied with the new eyes, but he had thrown his own away, so he had to
make the best of it. He could only travel at night on account of his new eyes. So
he had to make his living on rabbits, stealing them from the Indians’ snares. They
were all he could get. One day, as he was going along, he stopped and looked at his
tracks. Then he discovered that his paws were big and broad and so spread out when
he walked that they resembled snowshoes. They were so broad that he could walk over
the snow without snowshoes. So he went on.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day he decided to watch the Indians, so he sat down on a log near a hunter’s path
and waited for someone to come along. He waited all night and part of the day. Finally
some Indians came along the path to visit their rabbit snares. As they passed they
found the rabbits stolen from all their snares, but they did not mind it very much.
Some time after, one of the Indians’ little children came along the trail and saw
Wiske·djak with his big face and bulging eyes sitting on the stump. The child ran
back to camp and told his parents that he saw a big wildcat with bulging eyes staring
at him from a stump. Then the father of the child took his “arrow-head club,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1349src" href="#xd31e1349">8</a> and went to where the child said he saw the wildcat. Then he started clubbing Wiske·djak
to kill him. The fight was getting pretty bad, when Wiske·djak cried out, “Hold on,
hold on! it isn’t a lynx, it is Wiske·djak that you are pounding to death!” And Wiske·djak
tore off the lynx skin, and pitched it away. Then he took to the bush. That’s the
last I saw of him.

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(<i>7</i>)</span> <i>Ciŋgəbis.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ciŋgəbis was a remarkable fellow, a wonderful diver who could stay underneath the
water all day if he wanted to. He was married and lived with his wife’s people. One
time he had some kind of a dispute with them and they would not give in to him. So
he said he would go away. As it was winter time, there was a water hole in the ice
on the lake, and he went down and slid into the water and disappeared. His relatives
spent all day hunting for him along the shores, thinking he might come up along the
edge, but he did not. Then they went home and gave him up. In a few months, when his
wife’s brothers were out on the lake in their canoe, they spied a little duck swimming
a long way off, and paddled up to him. This was Ciŋgəbis. When they got near, they
recognized him and asked him, “Are you not Ciŋgəbis?” “Yes,” said he. “We thought
you were drowned. Are you coming back again?” “No,” said he, and fluttered his wings
and sank out of sight, leaving only his bill above the water, which they could not
see. This time he stayed under all day, and when night came, he left the country.
His wife’s people thought he was either dead or gone.
</p>
<p>Then Ciŋgəbis travelled to another village, where he heard there was a beautiful girl.
When he saw her all dressed up in fine clothes, new and beaded, he wanted to marry
her, and asked her parents for her. “Who are you?” they asked him. “I am Ciŋgəbis,”
said he. “Why, we heard you were drowned,” said they. “It is not true. Here I am.
I am Ciŋgəbis and alive.” “You cannot be Ciŋgəbis, because there is only one Ciŋgəbis,
and we heard he was drowned. But if you are, you cannot marry the girl, because you
have another wife.<span class="corr" id="xd31e1378" title="Source: ”’">”</span> Now Ciŋgəbis wanted the girl and stayed in the camp. He would not leave. So that
night they put one of the girl’s brothers to sleep alongside of him, so that he could
not secretly get to the wigwam where the girls slept. During the night he talked with
the brother and told him that he would show them how he could stay under water if
they would give him the girl. The next morning the young man told his parents about
it and they talked it over. They thought it might be good for their boys to know how
to stay under water, and at last gave their consent. So they gave <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>Ciŋgəbis the girl, and the next day went out on the lake to see him dive. The whole
family got in the canoe and they paddled out to the middle of the lake. “Now,” said
he, “let me out here.” Then he slid into the water and with his body stiff sank slowly
until he was out of sight. Then he struck out under water and reached the shore where
he hid under some rushes, just leaving his bill above the water. His nostrils were
at the end of his bill, so he could breathe with only a bit above water. They waited
for him half the day and, though the water was calm, could not see him, so they gave
him up and went home. That night he came back, to their surprise.
</p>
<p>They planned to go out again the next day and see him dive again. The next day they
went out and Ciŋgəbis dove again and swam among some reeds. He got under one lying
flat, and pushed it just a little above the water so that his nostrils were out of
water, yet covered by the stem of the rush. There he stayed a couple of hours out
of sight. When they were about to leave again, Ciŋgəbis shouted, “He! Here I am. Can
you see me?” They looked all around but could not see him. Then he came up in sight
and went back to the canoe. He explained how his nostrils were out at the end of his
bill and how he got under the reeds and hid there. Then he explained how in the winter
time he could dive through an air hole in the ice and swim to where the rushes grew
up through the ice, pull down one of the stalks, and put his bill in the opening and
get all the air he wanted. Said he, “I can stay there a week or a month, if I want,
only I get hungry. Then I dive to the bottom and eat some little mussels and things
on the bottom and come up to the hole again. In that way I can get along under the
ice all winter if I like.” That is how he did.
</p>
<p>Now, before long, his first wife’s family heard that Ciŋgəbis was alive and living
with another woman. They got angry and began to conjure to bring sickness upon his
new wife and her family. When his new wife and her people heard of this, they were
angry at Ciŋgəbis and wanted him to go away. But he would not consent. At last he
made an offer, because his mother-in-law wanted her daughter to leave him. He told
them that he would give up his new wife and her family if they would succeed in getting
her away from him unknown to him. <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>When they heard this, they began planning. For a whole year they thought of different
plans. At last the old mother-in-law said she had a plan, and told everyone in the
family to help her get up a big dance and invite all the people to come. Ciŋgəbis
was very jealous of his wife and had his camp apart from the others, lest some man
might take a fancy to his wife and take her away. His jealousy was known everywhere
and he never let her out of sight. Knowing this, the old mother-in-law made her plan.
She sent a special invitation to Ciŋgəbis and his wife and told her sons to try to
get him to come. Now Ciŋgəbis suspected some trick and told his wife not to go to
the dance. “If I have to go, you must stay here at home and not move away from the
wigwam.”
</p>
<p>When the night of the dance came, they got everything ready—the drum and rattles,
and everybody was coming from every camp. They prepared a kind of drink out of boiled
bark and herbs with tobacco juice in it, that would make people dizzy when they drank
it. Ciŋgəbis did not want to go to the dance at first, but everybody coaxed him until
he started. But he told his wife to stay at home and not leave for anything. Now this
was just what the old woman depended on, because she knew how jealous Ciŋgəbis was.
When the dance began, everybody began drinking some of the strong herb liquor and
it went to their heads and made them feel good, and dizzy. The old woman told her
sons to keep Ciŋgəbis well supplied with the drink and not <span class="corr" id="xd31e1390" title="Source: let to">to let</span> him leave until late. She then waited until the dancing was well started and everybody
was warmed up to it. Then she quietly slipped away when she saw that Ciŋgəbis was
dancing hard and feeling good with the drink. He had almost forgotten about his wife
and what might happen. The old woman went off into the woods to where there was a
dead spruce stump that was full of ants. She cut off the stump and got a piece about
the length of a person. The ants are asleep in the cold of night and will not rouse
when disturbed. The stump she took with her to Ciŋgəbis’ wigwam and quietly called
to her daughter inside. “Come, daughter, I have come to take you home away from Ciŋgəbis,”
she whispered. “You get up out of bed and leave everything as it is.” “All right,”
said the girl, and she packed up a few of her things and came out. <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>Then the old woman took the stump full of ants in and put it beneath the rabbitskin
blanket, covered it up just like the girl’s figure sleeping there, and the two then
fled to the mother’s camp.
</p>
<p>Ciŋgəbis stayed late at the dance. He drank a great deal of the liquor and got pretty
dizzy before he thought about going home. At last he left the dance and started for
his wigwam. He entered quietly. “Are you asleep?” he asked of his wife. There was
no answer. “Aha! that’s good,” said he. “I’ll let her sleep and then there will be
no danger of her being carried away tonight, as I am very sleepy with my weariness
and cannot keep awake to watch her tonight. That’s good; she is sound asleep.” And
he felt her blanket and found what he thought was her figure beneath the rabbitskin.
Then he lay down quietly beside her, so as not to awaken her, and pretty soon was
fast asleep.
</p>
<p>Before long some of the ants got warmed up by his body and began crawling over him.
“Oh! what’s that crawling over me! Do you know what it is that is creeping over us?”
he asked his wife, and gave the stump another poke with his elbow. No answer. “Well,
you are asleep yet. But that’s good. There won’t be any danger of your walking about
the camp attracting the other men while I am asleep. But oh! how those things bite.
I wonder what they are!” Then he dozed off again and was awakened again by the ants
stinging him. He managed to bear it all night, and in the morning woke up suddenly,
all bitten up. He jumped up, threw off the rabbitskin blanket, and instead of his
wife there lay the old rotten spruce stump swarming with ants.

<p class="first">Wiske·djak was always doing mischief in his lifetime among the Indians, so it is said.
He was always doing everything he could to plague his countrymen, the Indians. He
spent his life going about everywhere where there were Indians, to tease them and
play mischief among them. Because he was so funny, it was thought good to have him
going about in spite of his mischief. He had no canoe, so he always walked about,
going great distances here and there and everywhere, until he had travelled almost
all over the world, where he was heard of doing his mischievous pranks. He had the
power to make everything in creation answer him when he spoke to it; trees, water,
animals, and all the other little creatures would reply to him when he spoke. That
is all that can be said of Wiske·djak.

would move away and go near other people. He was always looking for trouble and got
it too, but in spite of all he was never killed. Indeed, nobody ever wanted to kill
him, even though he was causing so much mischief, because the people liked to have
him around. So he never came to an end. All of Wiske·djak’s pranks were done at different
times long ago, not all one after another at one time, as it might seem. He is still
living somewhere, but he is very quiet now, as we don’t hear of him doing anything
new nowadays.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following description of the ceremony attending the eating of a bear is based
on the accounts of three participants.
</p>
<p>When a bear has been killed, the families in the neighbourhood assemble at a camp
conveniently near. The hunter who has killed the bear becomes the host of the occasion,
which is called <i lang="oj">mα′gwαce·‵</i> “feast.” Slabs of birch bark are spread upon a clear space of ground to serve as
a sort of table. The carcass is then butchered, the head being cut off, including
the first vertebra, the long piece of breast fat is also cut off with the head, so
that the two remain together. The head with this mass of breast fat is then put into
a separate cooking vessel. Then the birch bark slabs, often 12 feet long, forming
the cover of some wigwam, are covered with the cut up portions of the meat. Birch
bark dishes are placed for each participant on the bark, with extra dishes for the
gravy. The grease from the cooking vessels is <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>then collected and put into a separate vessel to cool, so that it will be thick enough
to drink. When the meat has been boiled properly, all the guests are seated at their
places around the bark spread. Often they have a dance around it at this time. Before
they begin to eat, the chief goes around to each guest and with a big wooden spoon,
holding about a cupful and a half, gives each a spoonful of grease. Then they begin
to eat.
</p>
<p>When the feast is about half through, the chief gets up and decorates the bear’s head
with bright coloured ribbons about six inches long attached to little cedar sticks
about four inches long, with their ends split to hold the ribbons. These ribbon streamers
are stuck into the fat and about the head. Then the head itself is impaled on a stick
and, carrying this in his hand, the chief dances twice around the company, singing
a tune to a burden of syllables. After this performance the chief plants the stick
with the head upon it in the middle of the spread before all the guests, where it
is left. Then they finish eating.
</p>
<p>After the feast the oldest and most venerable man in the camp is presented with the
head and the attached breast fat, which he may either take home or distribute over
again to the company. After the feast is over the chief must go around and consume
what grease is left. This is to demonstrate his capacity as a man and hearty eater.
After all is over, the lower jaw bone is tied to the skull in its proper position
and black stripes are painted on the skull. This is then put on the stub end of a
branch of a tree facing from some prominent point toward the river or lake, near the
water’s edge. Here it can be seen by passers by as a reminder of the place and occasion
of the bear feast.
</p>
<p>The Indians themselves can give little comment on the meaning or reason of this ceremony,
except that it is done from respect to the bear and satisfaction in securing a bountiful
supply of meat. It belongs to the variously expressed series of bear rites widespread
among the northern tribes.

<p class="first">Once long ago a war party of Iroquois came north into this country to fight the Indians
at Abitibi. On the way they captured an old woman and took her with them to guide
them. <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>When they were on Abitibi river they drew near the big falls there without knowing
it. The old woman was made to stay in the first canoe. When she knew they were nearing
the falls she slowed up so that the flotilla of canoes became bunched. The approach
to the falls is very much concealed. All of a sudden they found themselves upon the
brink of the falls, and before they could help themselves they all went over. The
old woman was lost with the rest in saving her people from being massacred by the

<p class="first">There were two people living, a man and his wife, who had an only daughter. When she
was twelve years old, the age of puberty, she was taken over a hill and was kept there
in a camp alone for twelve days, neither eating nor drinking, in order that she might
have a dream.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1942src" href="#xd31e1942">2</a> If she should eat or drink, she would have no dream. If, while she was dreaming,
a panther came alone, she would be very strong. So her parents kept her there. The
girl dreamed of the sun, so she could not look at the sun any more, for if she did
so, she would have to go away from her parents and live with the sun. When the girl
had had this dream, she went back to her parents and her father asked her, “What have
you been dreaming?” “I am very sorry, but I have dreamed of the sun, so I cannot ever
look at the sun again,” replied his daughter. “Well, now it is too bad, but you mustn’t
look at the sun,” said her father. “You stay here all the time. Don’t look at the
sun, that’s all.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>The girl used to get water at the shore and stay there a long time. One day in March,
she went to the water hole, broke the ice and looked into the water. In so doing,
she made a mistake, for there was no cloud in the sky and the sun was shining brightly
near the horizon, so that, early in the morning, she looked at the sun.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1948src" href="#xd31e1948">3</a> She brought the water back in a birch bark pail and placed it inside the wigwam,
but she could not sit down. “What is the matter?” said her father. “Why, I looked
at the sun,” answered his daughter. “Well, good-bye, you’ve got to live with the sun
now,” said her father. Then the girl and her parents shook hands and she went away
to live with the sun, and is there yet. Before she went away she said to her father,
“You will see your grandchildren before long.” Then she told him to put his wooden
dish upside down before the fire and to leave it there four days and four nights and
to look under it every morning. Then she went to live with the sun.
</p>
<p>So the old man put the dish upside down before the fire. The first morning he lifted
the edge of the dish, looked under, and there he saw Nenebuc, the child of the sun,
sitting. The next morning he did the same thing and he saw Nenebuc’s brother sitting
with him. He kept doing this the third, fourth, and fifth mornings, until there were
Nenebuc and his four brothers all sitting under the dish. Then the old man picked
up the dish. One of the brothers, the second brother, had horns on his head and the
old man said to him, “You won’t stay here. You go to the west.” Then he sent one brother
to the east, one to the south, and one to the north. So Nenebuc, the eldest of the
five, was left. The old man told him to attend to the world and to keep the winds
going just right lest the water get stagnant and bad. Then Nenebuc stayed, and his
four brothers started to the four parts of the earth.
</p>
<p>One day Nenebuc asked his grandfather, “Where have I been born? Had I a mother like
other people?” His grandfather would not tell him, but his grandmother told him that
he had been found. This appeared queer to Nenebuc and he thought to himself, “The
other people have mothers, but I have none. I must find out.” So he took a whetstone
and, scraping it on a <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>rock, he asked it, “Have I any mother?” “Yes, you have a mother,” replied the whetstone
and then it told him his story. Then Nenebuc told his grandfather, “I have a mother
and four brothers besides. The whetstone told me so.”
</p>
<p>Soon Nenebuc began growing larger and he thought it strange that he had not been sent
out into the world like his brothers, so he asked his grandfather for what reason
he had kept him. His grandfather told him that he had kept him at home so that when
he became old and feeble Nenebuc would be able to help him, cut wood for him, and
hunt for him. This satisfied Nenebuc and he used to help his grandfather in many ways,
spearing fish for him in calm days, hunting for him, and doing many other things.
He never got into any mischief and he grew very fast.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One summer Nenebuc was unable to get fish for the whole summer on account of the high
winds. The people almost starved, and then Nenebuc became very angry. He did not like
to see his grandfather starving and his anger was aroused against the West Wind for
blowing so much. So he told his grandfather that he was going to kill the West Wind
for this, but the old man said to him, “Don’t kill him. Make him let the wind blow
a while and then stop, so that everything will be all right, but don’t kill him.”
“Well, I won’t be long away and I’ll punish my brother”, replied Nenebuc.
</p>
<p>So he went away and finally met his brother, the one with the two horns, who lived
in the west. Nenebuc hammered him soundly with a club and broke one of his horns.
This hurt him, but did not kill him. Then Nenebuc said, “Don’t blow so hard any more.
You don’t care for your grandfather, but I do and I fear he and the people will starve.”
Then he arranged things with his brother and went back. After this he went fishing
and found it calm with only a little puff of wind now and then. Then the West Wind
told his three brothers not to blow, for if they did Nenebuc would come and kill them.
The winds became frightened at this and did not blow at all, and because of this the
water grew thick and stagnant and Nenebuc was <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>unable to fish. Then his grandfather said, “We are going to die. There is no wind
and the water is bad. Did you kill the West Wind?” “No,” said Nenebuc. “I will go
and see him and tell him to send the wind once in a while, not too often but just
right.” So Nenebuc went to his brother, the West Wind, and said to him, “I came here
to tell you that I want a little wind once in a while, but not too much.” Then everything
was arranged satisfactorily. Shortly after this Nenebuc’s grandparents died and were
heard of no more.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1968src" href="#xd31e1968">4</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now Nenebuc grew up and was alone. He was a man and began to travel. He knew all kinds
of things concerning the trees, the world, and everything which his grandfather had
taught him. He set out on his first journey and went toward the mountains. In one
day’s walk he climbed over three great mountains, something that no man could do.
When he reached the top of the first mountain he found a goose and killed it. In like
manner he killed a goose on the tops of the second and third mountains. Then he went
down to the lake below. He was very, very tired from his first day’s journey. He made
a fire with his bow-drill<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1983src" href="#xd31e1983">5</a> and put his geese in the sand, which he had heated to bake them in. He buried them
with their legs sticking out. He lay down by the fire and <span lang="la">ano suo dixit</span> to watch the geese while he slept, so that no one would steal them. Just as he was
dozing off to sleep, <span lang="la">anus ejus dixit</span>, “Somebody’s coming for your geese!” and Nenebuc jumped up. <span lang="la">Sed anus ejus eum deci piebat</span>. It did this three or four times. At last Nenebuc grew angry. He took a club and
<span lang="la">anum suum percussit</span> and told it not to do that again. Then he went to sleep. Some people came along and
stole the geese, but left the legs sticking in the same place.
</p>
<p>When Nenebuc awoke, <span lang="la">anum suum interrogavit</span>, “Did any one come?” “I don’t know,” <span lang="la">anus ejus respondit</span>. “As soon as <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>you fell asleep, I slept. I don’t know.” Nenebuc then pulled up the legs of the geese
and found nothing else. “It’s well cooked,” said he. He made a big fire. “Now I’ll
punish you,” <span lang="la">ano suo dixit</span> and he held it over the fire. “<i lang="oj">Tcį·′įį!</i>” <span lang="la">clamavit anus ejus</span>. “You can cry all you want to. I’ll punish you,” said Nenebuc, <span lang="la">ano suo strepitum urendi faciente</span>. He didn’t feel the burns then. Then he started walking.
</p>
<p>Next day he felt a little sick and <span lang="la">anus ejus scabi osus fuit</span>. In walking he got turned around and saw his own tracks. “Somebody’s passed here,”
he said to himself, when he saw them. Then he saw some kind of meat lying on the ground,
and he tasted it. “Somebody had some meat here,” he said. Then the little bird <i lang="oj">Gitci·′gi·‵tci·gane‵cįc</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2028src" href="#xd31e2028">6</a> (Tom-tit) cried out, “<span lang="la">Nenebuc scabies suas edit!</span>” “Oh no, those are not my scabs. Some old woman passed by and left some dry meat,”
said he. But at last he discovered <span lang="la">se scabies suas edisse</span>, but even then he didn’t care. He kept on walking and felt very sick.
</p>
<p>By and by he came upon a brood of young partridges and said, “Where is your mother?”
“Our mother is away,” said they. “What’s your names?” They answered “<i lang="oj">Kαckuŋge′s·i</i>” (“Jump out and frighten”). Nenebuc turned around upon hearing this and <span lang="la">super totam familiam defaecavit</span>. Up to this time the Partridges had been white, but after this they have always been
brown.
</p>
<p>Then Nenebuc went to a high bluff near by. He was tired, sick, and hungry, and he
lay upon the bluff sleeping. Partridge came home and said to his young when he saw
what Nenebuc had done to them, “Who did this?” “A man came along and asked us our
name and, when we told him ‘<i lang="oj">Kαckuŋge′s·i</i>,’ <span lang="la">super nos defaecavit</span>. He said he wasn’t frightened by us.” And so the young Partridges told their father
where Nenebuc had gone. The old Partridge followed his tracks until he came to where
Nenebuc lay on the cliff. He saw him lying right on the edge, so he walked up slowly
to him and then suddenly buzzed his wings, and Nenebuc jumped up and fell over the
cliff. As he slid down, <span lang="la">anum suum in lapidibus scabit</span> and all the scabs rubbed off. As he lay on the ground he saw the scabs and said,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>“These Indians will call this <i lang="oj">wa·′kwαní</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2060src" href="#xd31e2060">7</a> and when they go hungry they can make soup for themselves, these Ojibwa, forever.”
Then he was cured.

<h5 class="main"><span class="divNum">(d)</span> <i>Nenebuc Prepares a Feast and Gets Caught Between Two Trees, While the Animals Receive
a Distribution of Fat.</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After this Nenebuc began travelling again. One time he feasted a lot of animals. He
had killed a big bear, which was very fat and he began cooking it, having made a fire
with his bow-drill. When he was ready to spread his meat, he heard two trees scraping
together, swayed by the wind. He didn’t like this noise while he was having his feast
and he thought he could stop it. He climbed up one of the trees and when he reached
the spot where the two trees were scraping, his foot got caught in a crack between
the trees and he could not free himself.
</p>
<p>When the first animal guest came along and saw Nenebuc in the tree, he, the Beaver,
said “Come on to the feast, Nenebuc is caught and can’t stop us.” And then the other
animals came. The Beaver jumped into the grease and ate it, and the Otter did the
same, and that is why they are so fat in the belly. The Beaver scooped up the grease
and smeared it on himself, and that is the reason why he is so fat now. All the small
animals came and got fat for themselves. Last of all the animals came the Rabbit,
when nearly all the grease was gone—only a little left. So he put some on the nape
of his neck and some on his groin and for this reason he has only a little fat in
those places. So all the animals got their fat except Rabbit. Then they all went,
and poor Nenebuc got free at last. He looked around and found a bear’s skull that
was all cleaned except for the brain, and there was only a little of that left, but
he couldn’t get at it. Then he wished himself to be changed into an ant in order to
get into the skull and get enough to eat, for there was only about an ant’s meal left.

<h5 class="main"><span class="divNum">(e)</span> <i>Nenebuc Gets Caught in the Bear’s Skull.</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then he became an ant and entered the skull. When he had enough he turned back into
a man, but he had his head inside <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>the skull; this allowed him to walk but not to see. On account of this he had no idea
where he was. Then he felt the trees. He said to one, “What are you?” It answered,
“Cedar.” He kept doing this with all the trees in order to keep his course. When he
got too near the shore, he knew it by the kind of trees he met. So he kept on walking
and the only tree that did not answer promptly was the black spruce, and that said,
“I’m <i lang="oj">Se·′se·ga‵ndαk</i>” (black spruce). Then Nenebuc knew he was on low ground. He came to a lake, but he
did not know how large it was, as he couldn’t see. He started to swim across. An Ojibwa
was paddling on the lake with his family and he heard someone calling, “Hey! There’s
a bear swimming across the lake.” Nenebuc became frightened at this and the Ojibwa
then said, “He’s getting near the shore now.” So Nenebuc swam faster, and as he could
understand the Ojibwa language, he guided himself by the cries. He landed on a smooth
rock, slipped and broke the bear’s skull, which fell off his head. Then the Ojibwa
cried out, “That’s no bear! That’s Nenebuc!” Nenebuc was all right, now that he could
see, so he ran off, as he didn’t want to stay with these people.

Her.</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He had his bow and arrow with him, and as he went along he saw a great snake.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2092src" href="#xd31e2092">8</a> He shot it with his arrow. He came to a big lake with a nice, sandy shore, where
he saw Lions<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2095src" href="#xd31e2095">9</a> (<i lang="oj">mici·′bi­zi‵w</i> “giant lynx”). He couldn’t shoot them with his arrow as they were too far away, nor
was there any place where he could hide himself until they came to sun themselves
by the shore, when they felt too cold in the water. Finally he hit upon a plan. He
took some birch bark from a rotten stump, rolled it into a hollow cylinder, and placed
it, like a wigwam, near the shore. He got inside and made a little hole in the bark
through which to shoot and kill the Lions.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the Lions saw the thing on the beach, they grew curious to find out what this
strange thing was on the beach that was not there the day before. So they sent a big
snake to twist around it and to try to upset it, but the snake did not succeed in
doing this, for Nenebuc stood too firm. So the Lions came ashore upon the sand and
Nenebuc shot one of them with his arrow—a she-lion, the wife of the Lion chief. He
did not kill her, but wounded her badly in the side, and the flint arrow point stayed
in the wound. She was very badly wounded and went back to a hole which led to a cave
in a big rock where she lived.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2107src" href="#xd31e2107">10</a> Nenebuc was sorry that he had not killed the Lion queen.
</p>
<p>As he went along the shore, the next morning, he heard someone singing and shaking
a rattle. Nenebuc stood there wondering and waiting, and pretty soon he saw an old
woman making the song. So he went across to see her, and when they met, he asked her,
“What are you doing?” “I’m a doctor,” she answered. “The queen of the Lions has been
shot by Nenebuc and I am going to cure her.” She didn’t know that it was Nenebuc to
whom she was talking, for she was too old. So Nenebuc told her, “Let me hear you singing.
Is that what you are going to do to cure her?” “Yes, I will sing and then pull out
that arrow.” The Lions had sent for her at the foot of the lake to cure the queen.
Nenebuc picked up a club and killed her, saying, “You are no doctor (<i lang="oj">macki·ki·′winini‵k·we</i> ‘medicine-person woman’) at all.” Then he discovered that she was no person at all,
but a big toad (<i lang="oj"><span class="corr" id="xd31e2116" title="Source: omα′kαk·i.‵">omα′kαk·i·‵</span></i>). So he skinned her and put on the skin. The skin had a hole in the groin, and as
he had no needle to sew it up with, his scrotum hung out when he put it on himself.
This did not worry Nenebuc, for he thought, “It will be all right, unless they notice
me too closely.” So he walked past the cave in which the Lions lived and kept singing
and rattling all the time.
</p>
<p>When the young lions heard him, they said, “There’s the old medicine woman coming.”
They were very glad to think that their mother would be cured. So they opened the
door in the rock and Nenebuc went in, and one of the daughters came to <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>meet him and said, “Come in, old woman.” They were very much pleased. Nenebuc said,
“Don’t shut the doors. Leave them open, as the queen needs plenty of fresh air!”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2123src" href="#xd31e2123">11</a> Then he said, “I’m hungry. I’ve had a long walk and I’m tired.” Then they gave him
a good meal first. While he was eating, he sat with open legs and the children cried
out, “Look at the old woman with testicles hanging out!” But the older ones told them
to be silent, as they thought some old women had testicles.
</p>
<p>When he had finished eating, Nenebuc said, “Don’t watch me. I’m going to pull out
the arrow point. You will hear her suffering and me singing, but don’t look until
you hear her stop suffering. Then she will be cured, and the arrow point will be out.
So don’t look, for I am going to cure her.” Then he began rattling and singing, and,
as he did so, he shoved the arrow point farther into the wound of the queen in order
to kill her. When she yelled, her people thought that the hurt was caused in pulling
it out. At last one of the little lion children peeped and saw Nenebuc pushing the
arrow farther in. He told his sister, “That’s Nenebuc himself inside!” Then Nenebuc
ran outside and the Queen Lion was dying. Nenebuc had difficulty to clear himself.
He pulled off the toad skin and tried to climb up the rock.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As soon as the queen died, a giant stream poured out of the cave and the lake began
rising. “That is going to flood the world and be the end,” said Nenebuc. So he cut
trees and made a kind of raft.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2135src" href="#xd31e2135">12</a> So he had his raft ready, and the end of the world came. He couldn’t see any trees,
water covered everything, and he made the flood. He saw all kinds of animals swimming
toward his raft and he took them on. “Come on, come on,” he cried, “and stay here.”
For he wanted to save them, so that after the flood there would be all kinds of animals.
The animals stayed on the raft with him for a long while. Some time after <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>this he made a rope of roots and tied it to the Beaver’s tail, telling him to dive
and to try and reach the land underneath. He knew the water would get lower afterwards.
The Beaver couldn’t reach the land and he came up to the surface of the water again.
</p>
<p>Seven days after this he allowed the Muskrat to try and bring the land. Muskrat dove
and they waited for a long time, but he didn’t come up. This Muskrat doubled up and
put his nose into the hair of his breast which enabled him to breathe by the bubbles
clinging there. By doing this he could rest and dive still deeper. At last he used
up all the air in his breast hair and could only grab a little piece of mud. Then
he started up to the surface of the water, but drowned before he reached the raft.
Nenebuc pulled the Muskrat in and he still was holding the mud. Nenebuc said, “I am
going to dry this. As soon as it is dry, you can all run around again and have this
world.” So he dried it, but not entirely, and that is the reason why some parts of
the world are swampy and wet, while others are dry like this. So the animals had the
earth again and the world was made.

<p class="first">Nenebuc knew the world was round like a ball, but he didn’t know how large it was.
He was sitting down, tired. So he said to Crow, “Go fly around the world and don’t
eat until you come back again. If you do, we will know it.” Crow at that time was
white. Crow had to do as he was told, because Nenebuc was chief of all men and animals.
So Crow started and flew and flew along the salt water beach. Soon he became very
hungry and wondered how far he was away from Nenebuc. One morning he was flying along
the shore and he saw an old dead fish. He was so hungry that he tasted a little bit
of it, and finally made a meal of it. When he finished eating, he found he had turned
black. This is the way Crow became black.
</p>
<p>When Crow reached the place from which he started out, he found Nenebuc and all the
animals waiting for him. He told Nenebuc that he had eaten, and then Nenebuc said
to Gull, <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>“You go try. Do the same and don’t eat until you come here.” So Gull went. When he
got to the same place at which Crow had felt hungry, Gull felt hungry. One morning
he saw the same dead fish. He thought, “Well, I <span class="corr" id="xd31e2158" title="Source: musn’t">mustn’t</span> eat it, for if I do, I’ll be as black as Crow.” He took one mouthful and started
flying. When Gull returned, Nenebuc could see a little black on his wings, so he said,
“Gull has had a mouthful too.”
</p>
<p>Then he told Owl, “You go and try to go around the world this time. If you eat, you
won’t change colour but remain the same colour as you are now. But if you eat, you
won’t come back here.” So Owl started flying. He came to the same lake, saw the dead
fish and finished it. He ate a good meal and never returned.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2163src" href="#xd31e2163">13</a> But he didn’t change colour.

<p>Then Nenebuc let all the animals go from the raft. He started west and is there yet,
lying on his back, singing and hammering at his wigwam poles, in place of drumming,
all the time. He will stay there until he gets up again three years before the end

high he was and looked down. Then he tumbled down and down until he fell into a big
hollow stump where he couldn’t get out. Soon two girls came along with an axe to get
some wood and began cutting at the hollow pine in which Nenebuc was. They cut a hole
and Nenebuc kept quiet, for he was hoping they would free him. When they looked in
the hole, they saw his belly and they pulled out a hair. They went back to camp and
told their father, “Here is a porcupine quill we <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>found in a tree.” The old man looked at it and, laughing, said, “That’s not a porcupine

Now I am going to make you small and harmless.” Then he made him into the Squirrel

so badly that he cried until his eyebrows turned grey. That is the reason why to this
day squirrels have grey eyelids.
</p>
<p>“Now,” said Nenebuc, “what will you eat?” The Bear, now a Squirrel, said he would
continue to eat people, but he was so small that he could not do anything. “That is
good,” said Nenebuc. “Now you can’t do any harm to the Indians. But you had better
change your food. Just run up that black-spruce tree and taste the acorn seeds and
then see whether you want to eat people any more. You are too small to eat people
as you used to do.” So the Squirrel ran up the black-spruce tree and tasted the sweet
seed of the cone. He liked it so well, it tasted so sweet, that he chose this for
his food and said that he would not want anything better any more. That is his food

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Wemicus had a very large family. Many of his children had married the different animals
who lived in various parts of the surrounding country. By and by he had nearly all
kinds of animals for his sons-in-law, and there were still a great many children left
in his family. When winter came, Wemicus was unable to support his family, as there
were too many of them. They were all living in one wigwam.
</p>
<p>One day Wemicus said to his wife, “We are all very hungry. I might go and see one
of our sons-in-law; he might have some <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>food.” Next morning he started out. Wemicus always tried to imitate the actions of
everybody he saw. When he reached the home of his son-in-law Ninicip (Black Duck)
he saw that he also had a large family. Ninicip was inside of his wigwam, and when
he saw Wemicus coming, he told his wife, “You had better begin to get ready for company
and boil water in the stone pail.” Then he jumped up upon the cross poles in his wigwam<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2206src" href="#xd31e2206">16</a> and <span lang="la">in vas lapidum sub se<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2211src" href="#xd31e2211">17</a> defaecavit</span>, telling his wife to stir up the contents of the pot. Wemicus apparently saw nothing
of this. Then one of the children of Ninicip took spoons and, dipping them in the
pot, said, “Soup, soup, soup, rice soup.” Wemicus tasted the soup, thought it tasted
good, and decided that after this he would make soup in the same manner.
</p>
<p>The next morning, when Wemicus started for home, he was given some rice soup to take
home to his children. Before leaving the wigwam of Ninicip, however, Wemicus had purposely
left behind one of his mittens. One of the children saw the mitten and Ninicip’s wife
sent the child to return it, bidding him not to go too close to Wemicus but to throw
him the mitten. The child did the bidding of his mother and, when the mitten was thrown
to Wemicus, he said, “Ask your father to come and see me,” and he named a certain
day. On the way back home Wemicus thought, “I wonder what this soup tastes like when
it is cold. I must try it. My children don’t need any of it, so I might as well eat
it all.” So he ate all of the soup. When he reached his wigwam he said, “Ninicip and
his family are starving also. To-morrow he will come to see us and perhaps he will
bring us something. We had better fix up our wigwam.” Then they fixed up the wigwam
in the same manner as that of Ninicip. The next day Ninicip came and they gave him
the best place. Wemicus said to his wife, “We’ll get ready to eat now. Put some water
in the stone pail.” “There is no use putting any water in the pail,” answered his
wife, “we have nothing to cook.” “Well, bring the pail, anyway, and get some spoons,”
said Wemicus. When the water began boiling, Wemicus jumped up on the cross-poles,
<span lang="la">in vas defaecavit</span>, all over his children and the inside of the wigwam. Then Ninicip went out. His wife
<span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>scolded Wemicus, saying, “You always do something like that. You must have seen someone
do that.” Then Wemicus kept quiet and everything had to be cleaned up. The wife then
invited Ninicip to come in again and he told her that he would fix up the meal. <span lang="la">Igituo interum in vas defaecavit</span> and they had good rice soup, and everyone, even Wemicus, had a good meal. The following
morning Ninicip made soup for the family again and then went home. Soon Wemicus and
his family were starving again and Wemicus said, “I must go and see my son-in-law,
Muskrat. He lives not far away.” “All right,” said his wife and Wemicus set out. When
he had almost reached Muskrat’s home, the little Muskrat children called out, “Our
grandfather is coming.” Wemicus told Muskrat that he was starving and Muskrat said
to his wife, “You had better make a fire in the hot sand.” So the fire was made, and
Muskrat went out with a big sack made out of hide and returned with the sack full
of ice, which he dumped into the hot ashes. Wemicus expected that it would explode
but it only cooked nicely. Wemicus wondered what it was. Soon Muskrat said, “We are
ready now,” and they took off the sand and there were a lot of nicely baked potatoes.
Wemicus thought that was an easy way in which to live—just to get ice for potatoes.
</p>
<p>Next morning Wemicus started out for home and left his mitten behind as he had done
with Ninicip. Muskrat’s wife sent a child after him and told the child, “Don’t go
too close to Wemicus. He’s always in mischief.” Everything happened as before. The
child threw the mitten to Wemicus and Wemicus sent an invitation to Muskrat to come
to his home the next day. As Wemicus went on his way he had some potatoes which Muskrat
had given him for his family. Half way home he rested and thought he would eat the
potatoes, as they looked very good. So he ate every one. “I am the one who works hard,”
he said to himself. “My family can wait until Muskrat comes.” When he reached home
he told his wife, “Muskrat is also starving. I brought nothing. Muskrat is coming
tomorrow to see us.” Next day Muskrat came and they put him on the opposite side of
the wigwam. Wemicus said, “We have nothing much, but, wife, make a fire in the hot
sand.” The wife answered, “I suppose you saw somebody else do something. Don’t <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>you try any more mischief.” But he made his wife make the fire. He then went out and
returned with the sack full of ice, which he dumped on the fire. The sack blew up
all over everybody and put out the fire. Then his wife said, “I suppose you saw someone
do that again.” She made another fire and Muskrat said, “Give me that bag.” He went
out and brought back the sack full of ice, dumped and buried it in the fire, and,
after a while, they got the potatoes. All of them had a good meal. The next morning,
before Muskrat left, he got them another bag of potatoes.
</p>
<p>Wemicus does not work, although his family is so large. Well, pretty soon the whole
family was starving again. Then said Wemicus, “I must go and see Meme (pileated woodpecker),
my son-in-law.” He went into the bush and when he reached Meme’s wigwam he found a
large white pine in back of it. He noticed that Meme had a sharp pointed nose. He
saw that Meme had not much to live on, but nevertheless Meme told his wife to get
the cooking pail ready. Then Meme began climbing the pine tree, which was at the back
of his wigwam, and began pecking in the trunk with his nose. Pretty soon he came down
with a raccoon.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2234src" href="#xd31e2234">18</a> When Wemicus saw this, he thought, “That is a great thing; I must try it.” Meme burned
off the hair and cleaned the raccoon, and shared the meat on a stick to each one.
Wemicus received the best part, as he was the grandfather.
</p>
<p>The next morning they had another raccoon to eat. Then everything happened as before.
Wemicus was given a raccoon to take home. He left his mitten behind, and sent an invitation
to Meme to visit him the next day. On the way home Wemicus thought to himself, “I
wonder how this raccoon tastes cold.” So he ate the entire raccoon. When he got home,
he told his wife that Meme was starving but that he was coming to visit them the following
day. They put the wigwam in order and Wemicus fixed up a big pine like that belonging
to Meme and cut two pieces of wood, which he pointed and shoved into his nose to imitate
Meme. When Meme came along he saw Wemicus sitting there with sticks in his nose. Wemicus
told his wife, as usual, to prepare for supper, and she told him that they had nothing.
When she had the water boiling in the pail, <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>Wemicus climbed up the tree and pecked upon it in imitation of Meme. He fell down,
however, and drove the sticks into his head. He fell into the fire, but after a while
he gained consciousness. Then Meme stepped out of the wigwam, climbed the tree, and
brought down a raccoon. And then the whole family had a good supper. Next morning
Meme got another raccoon and left it for the family, and then went home.
</p>
<p>Still Wemicus did nothing and the family was again in a starving condition. Then said
Wemicus, “I have some more sons-in-law and one is close. I will go and see him; he
will help me until open water.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2243src" href="#xd31e2243">19</a> I will go and see Skunk.” So he set out to visit Skunk. Wemicus was pretty hungry
and Skunk was farther off than the rest of the sons-in-law, but he finally reached
his home. Wemicus found Skunk’s water hole<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2246src" href="#xd31e2246">20</a> and saw a great quantity of oil in it. He knew that Skunk must have killed a great
deal of game. So he went into Skunk’s wigwam and saw a great quantity of food. Skunk
said, “We don’t have much. It is long since I hunted. But come outside.” There Wemicus
saw a piece of ground fenced in. Skunk then produced a little birch bark horn<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2249src" href="#xd31e2249">21</a> and said, “What will you have?” Skunk now blew on his horn and all kinds of game
came inside the enclosure. Skunk <span lang="la">deinde pepedit</span> and killed whatever kind Wemicus wanted. They then skinned what he killed and fried
it for supper.
</p>
<p>In the morning Skunk said to Wemicus, “I’ll give you three shots and a horn. You can
make a fence for yourself. This horn will last forever, as long as you don’t lose
it. If you do, it will be bad.” Then Skunk gave Wemicus three shots to be used in
the future, and he did this <span lang="la">urinando super eum</span> to load him up three times. He did not give him any food, because he would be able
to get enough for himself. Then Wemicus thought, “Now I am going to do something.”
As Wemicus was on his way home he said to himself, “I wonder if it will go off!” So,
just as he was passing a tree stump, <span lang="la">pepedit</span> at the stump and blew it up. “That’s fine, but I have only two more shots left,”
said he. Later he tried the same thing and then only had one <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>left. A little while after this he saw a big pine tree, and thought he would try a
shot at this. So he blew up the pine tree, and so used up all his shots.
</p>
<p>When he reached his wigwam, he showed his wife the horn which Skunk had given him,
saying, “Skunk gave me that.” Then he built a large fence of poles. He told his wife
to hold the horn and stay near by, while he got a club to kill the game with. Then
he blew on the horn and the fence was filled with bear, deer, and all kinds of animals.
Although he had no shots left, Wemicus managed to kill one caribou, and his wife was
very happy. He cut the fat from the breast of the caribou, made a fire, and got some
grease from it. He then spilled the caribou grease in his water hole in order to deceive
Skunk and make him believe that he had a great quantity of meat. Not long after this
Skunk started out to visit Wemicus and, on his way, he passed the three stumps which
Wemicus had blown up and knew that he had no more shots left. When he <span class="corr" id="xd31e2267" title="Source: rached">reached</span> <span class="corr" id="xd31e2270" title="Source: Wemicus’s">Wemicus’</span> water hole he said, “I guess he got one any way.” When he came to the wigwam, he
found that Wemicus and his family had hardly any meat left, so he said to Wemicus,
“Come out and let me see your fence.” They went out and Wemicus blew his horn, and
inside the fence it became full of game. Skunk pepedit and killed all of them, and
then Wemicus and his family had plenty. Skunk stayed over night and departed the next
morning.
</p>
<p>Wemicus had another son-in-law who was a man. This man’s wife, the daughter of Wemicus,
had had a great many husbands, because Wemicus had put them to so many different tests
that they had been all killed off except this one. He, however, had succeeded in outwitting
Wemicus in every scheme that he tried on him. Wemicus and this man hunted beaver in
the spring of the year by driving them all day with dogs. The man’s wife warned him
before they started out to hunt, saying, “Look out for my father; he might burn your
moccasins in camp. That’s what he did to my other husbands.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2275src" href="#xd31e2275">22</a> That night in camp Wemicus said, “I didn’t tell you the name of this lake. It is
called ‘burnt moccasins lake.’ ” When the man <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>heard this, he thought that Wemicus was up to some sort of mischief and was going
to burn his moccasins. Their moccasins were hanging up before a fire to dry and, while
Wemicus was not looking, the man changed the places of Wemicus’ moccasins and his
own, and then went to sleep. Soon the man awoke and saw Wemicus get up and throw his
own moccasins into the fire. Wemicus then said, “Say! something is burning; it is
your moccasins.” Then the man answered, “No, not mine, but yours.” So Wemicus had
no moccasins, and the ground was covered with snow. After this had happened the man
slept with his moccasins on.
</p>
<p>The next morning the man started on and left Wemicus there with no shoes. Wemicus
started to work. He got a big boulder, made a fire, and placed the boulder in it until
it became red hot. He then wrapped his feet with spruce boughs and pushed the boulder
ahead of him in order to melt the snow. In this way he managed to walk on the boughs.
Then he began to sing, “Spruce is warm, spruce is warm.” When the man reached home
he told his wife what had happened. “I hope Wemicus will die,” she said. A little
while after this, they heard Wemicus coming along singing, “Spruce is warm, spruce
is warm.” He came into the wigwam and, as he was the head man, they were obliged to
get his meal ready.
</p>
<p>The ice was getting bad by this time, so they stayed in camp a while. Soon Wemicus
told his son-in-law, “We’d better go sliding.” He then went to a hill where there
were some very poisonous snakes. The man’s wife warned her husband of these snakes
and gave him a split stick holding a certain kind of magic tobacco, which she told
him to hold in front of him so that the snakes would not hurt him. Then the two men
went sliding. At the top of the hill Wemicus said, “Follow me,” for he intended to
pass close by the snakes’ lair. So when they slid, Wemicus passed safely and the man
held his stick with the tobacco in it in front of him, thus preventing the snakes
from biting him. The man then told Wemicus that he enjoyed the sliding.
</p>
<p>The following day Wemicus said to his son-in-law, “We had better go to another place.”
When she heard this, the wife told her husband that, as it was getting summer, Wemicus
had in <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>his head many poisonous lizards instead of lice. She said, “He will tell you to pick
lice from his head and crack them in your teeth. But take low-bush cranberries and
crack them instead.” So the man took cranberries along with him. Wemicus took his
son-in-law to a valley with a great ravine in it. He said, “I wonder if anybody can
jump across this?” “Surely,” said the young man, “I can.” Then the young man said,
“Closer,” and the ravine narrowed and he jumped across easily. When Wemicus tried,
the young man said “Widen,” and Wemicus fell into the ravine. But it did not kill
him, and when he made his way to the top again, he said, “You have beaten me.” Then
they went on.
</p>
<p>They came to a place of hot sand and Wemicus said, “You must look for lice in my head.”
“All right father,” replied the son-in-law. So Wemicus lay down and the man started
to pick the lice. He took the cranberries from inside his shirt and each time he pretended
to catch a louse, he cracked a cranberry and threw it on the ground, and so Wemicus
got fooled a second time that day. Then they went home and Wemicus said to his son-in-law,
“There are a whole lot of eggs on that rocky island where the gulls are. We will go
get the eggs, come back, and have an egg supper.” As Wemicus was the head man, his
son-in-law had to obey him.
</p>
<p>So they started out in their canoe and soon came to the rocky island. Wemicus stayed
in the canoe and told the man to go ashore and to bring the eggs back with him and
fill the canoe. When the man reached the shore, Wemicus told him to go farther back
on the island, saying, “That’s where the former husbands got their eggs, there are
their bones.” He then started the canoe off in the water by singing, without using
his paddle. Then Wemicus told the gulls to eat the man, saying to them, “I give you
him to eat.” The gulls started to fly about the man, but the man had his paddle with
him and he killed one of the gulls with it. He then took the gulls’ wings and fastened
them on himself, filled his shirt with eggs, and started flying over the lake by the
aid of the wings.
</p>
<p>When he reached the middle of the lake, he saw Wemicus going along and singing to
himself. Wemicus, looking up, saw his son-in-law but mistook him for a gull. Then
the man flew <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>over him and defecated in his face, and Wemicus said, “Gull’s excrement always smells
like that when they have eaten a man.” The man flew back to camp and told his wife
to cook the eggs, and he told his children to play with the wings. When Wemicus reached
the camp, he saw the children playing with the wings and said, “Where did you get
those wings?” “From father,” was the reply. “Your father? Why, the gulls ate him!”
Then he went to the wigwam and there he saw the man smoking. Then Wemicus thought
it very strange how the man could have gotten home, but no one told him how it had
been done. Thought he, “I must try another scheme to do away with him.”
</p>
<p>One day Wemicus said to his son-in-law, “We’d better make two canoes of birch-bark,
one for you and one for me. We’d better get bark.” So they started off for birch-bark.
They cut a tree almost through and Wemicus said to his son-in-law, “You sit on that
side and I’ll sit on this.” He wanted the tree to fall on him and kill him. Wemicus
said, “You say, ‘Fall on my father-in-law,’ and I’ll say, ‘Fall on my son-in-law’,
and whoever says it too slowly or makes a mistake will be the one on whom it will
fall.” But Wemicus made the first mistake, and the tree fell on him and crushed him.
However, Wemicus was a manitu<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2295src" href="#xd31e2295">23</a> and was not hurt. They went home with the bark and made the two canoes. After they
were made, Wemicus said to his son-in-law, “Well, we’ll have a race in our two canoes,
a sailing race.” Wemicus made a big bark sail, but the man did not make any, as he
was afraid of upsetting. They started the race. Wemicus went very fast and the man
called after him, “Oh, you are beating me.” He kept on fooling and encouraging Wemicus,
until the wind upset Wemicus’ canoe and that was the end of Wemicus. When the man
sailed over the spot where Wemicus had upset, he saw a big pike (<i lang="oj">ki·nų′je</i>) there, into which Wemicus had been transformed when the canoe upset. This is the
origin of the pike.

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(5)</span> <span class="sc">Ciŋgibis.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the time of which my story speaks people were camping just as we are here. In the
winter time they used birch bark <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>wigwams. All animals could then talk together. Two girls, who were very foolish, talked
foolishly and were in no respect like the other girls of their tribe, made their bed
out-of-doors, and slept right out under the stars. The very fact that they slept outside
during the winter proves how foolish they were.
</p>
<p>One of these girls asked the other, “With what star would you like to sleep, the white
one or the red one?” The other girl answered, “I’d like to sleep with the red star.”
“Oh, that’s all right,” said the first one, “I would like to sleep with the white
star. He’s the younger; the red is the older.” Then the two girls fell asleep. When
they awoke, they found themselves in another world, the star world. There were four
of them there, the two girls and the two stars who had become men. The white star
was very, very old and was grey-headed, while the younger was red-headed. He was the
red star. The girls stayed a long time in this star world, and the one who had chosen
the white star was very sorry, for he was so old.
</p>
<p>There was an old woman up in this world who sat over a hole in the sky, and, whenever
she moved, she showed them the hole and said, “That’s where you came from.” They looked
down through and saw their people playing down below, and then the girls grew very
sorry and very homesick. One evening, near sunset, the old woman moved a little way
from the hole.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2315src" href="#xd31e2315">24</a>
</p>
<p>The younger girl heard the noise of the <i lang="oj">mite′win</i> down below. When it was almost daylight, the old woman sat over the hole again and
the noise of <i lang="oj">mite′win</i> stopped; it was her spirit that made the noise. She was the guardian of the <i lang="oj">mite′win</i>.
</p>
<p>One morning the old woman told the girls, “If you want to go down from where you came
from, we will let you down, but get to work and gather roots to make a string-made
rope, twisted. The two of you make coils of rope as high as your heads when you are
sitting. Two coils will be enough.” The girls worked for days until they had accomplished
this. They made plenty of rope and tied it to a big basket. They then got into the
basket and the people of the star world lowered them down. They descended right into
an Eagle’s nest, but the people above <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>thought the girls were on the ground and stopped lowering them. They were obliged
to stay in the nest, because they could do nothing to help themselves.
</p>
<p>Said one, “We’ll have to stay here until some one comes to get us.” Bear passed by.
The girls cried out, “Bear, come and get us. You are going to get married sometime.
Now is your chance!” Bear thought, “They are not very good-looking women.” He pretended
to climb up and then said, “I can’t climb up any further.” And he went away, for the
girls didn’t suit him. Next came Lynx. The girls cried out again, “Lynx, come up and
get us. You will go after women some day!” Lynx answered, “I can’t, for I have no
claws,” and he went away. Then an ugly-looking man, Wolverine, passed and the girls
spoke to <span class="corr" id="xd31e2341" title="Source: hin">him</span>. “Hey, Wolverine, come and get us.” Wolverine started to climb up, for he thought
it a very fortunate thing to have these women and was very glad. When he reached them,
they placed their hair ribbons in the nest. Then Wolverine agreed to take one girl
at a time, so he took the first one down and went back for the next. Then Wolverine
went away with his two wives and enjoyed himself greatly, as he was ugly and nobody
else would have him. They went far into the woods, and then they sat down and began
to talk. “Oh!” cried one of the girls, “I forgot my hair ribbons.” Then Wolverine
said, “I will run back for it.” And he started off to get the hair ribbons. Then the
girls hid and told the trees, whenever Wolverine should come back and whistle for
them, to <span class="corr" id="xd31e2344" title="Source: anwser">answer</span> him by whistling. Wolverine soon returned and began to whistle for his wives, and
the trees all around him whistled in answer. Wolverine, realizing that he had been
tricked, gave up the search and departed very angry.
</p>
<p>The girls continued through the woods until they came to a big marsh, late in the
afternoon. There they saw a big birch bark house. Everything around the house was
very clean, the poles were scraped clean of their bark and were perfectly white, while
there was neither smoke nor ashes to be seen anywhere. The girls looked at this and
said, “The person who lives here must be very clean; we have never seen such a clean
house.” There was no dry or green wood lying around, but inside the house they saw
a fire-place and plenty of hay. One girl said <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>to the other, “We’d better cut a little wood.” So they cut wood and made the fire
in case the man came home late. By this time, the ice was beginning to break. Late
in the evening they heard someone crying out, “Who spoiled my wigwam? Who made smoke
and ashes?” The owner of the wigwam didn’t know who had done this, so he came in and
looked at the two girls. He then cut all the wood. This man was Woodpecker (Meme “pileated
woodpecker”). Woodpecker made a fire of the hay, which was beaver hay. It gave no
smoke to stain the wigwam and burned as well as wood. He brought in two nice beavers
which belonged to him, and gave one to the girls, saying, “You can have this.” He
then cooked the other one for himself. He showed the girls where to sleep and since
the place where they were to sleep was not near him, they knew that he would not marry
either of them.
</p>
<p>Next morning, after breakfast, he said to them, “Go! Don’t stay here. You go that
way and you will find a big river. There you’ll find lots of people and maybe you’ll
get married.” So the girls went on. They left Woodpecker and he is there yet. They
came to the big river and beheld canoes and all kinds of people passing. First they
saw White Duck (<i lang="oj">wa′bəci·p</i>). He was a good looking man, and as he passed them in his canoe, the girls said to
him, “Put us in your canoe, you are going to get married sometime.” White Duck answered,
“My canoe is too small. Other people are coming; they will marry you.” And he passed
on. Next came Fish Duck (<i lang="oj">azi′k</i>), a good looking man. They cried out, “Put us in your canoe, you are going to get
married anyway.” “No, my canoe is too small,” replied Fish Duck. A great many people
passed, but all of them said that their canoes were too small, so the girls had to
stay where they were. The people were passing to the mouth of the creek where the
village of the chief was. At last came Black Duck (<i lang="oj">ni′nicip</i>). He was also nice looking. “Come over and get us; you will get married sometime,”
cried the girls. “No, My canoe is too small. Ciŋgibis is coming soon and he will marry
you.” He was going to be the last person to pass. At last Ciŋgibis came along.
</p>
<p>When they saw him, one of the girls said, “He is a very ugly man, but we will go in
his canoe and, when we get to the village, <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>we’ll get rid of him.” So they called out to him, “Come over and get us; you will
get married anyway.” Ciŋgibis was very glad to have two wives, so he paddled over
and got the two girls. They said, “Your canoe is a very small canoe.” “Oh no,” said
Ciŋgibis, “my canoe is a magic canoe. It is enough.” So the girls got into the canoe
and they went down the stream. By and by one girl said, “I’m getting hungry.” “Well,”
said <span class="corr" id="xd31e2366" title="Source: Cŋgibis">Ciŋgibis</span>, “not far down is a nice rock and there we will have lunch. You can pull roots for
lunch.” So Ciŋgibis and the two girls went ashore and pulled roots and made a string
out of them. “That’s enough,” said Ciŋgibis to one of the girls. “Tie the string to
my leg and I’ll dive for something to eat. When you see the string jerk, pull me up.”
They did this, and he dove into the water. When the girls saw the string jerk, they
pulled him up and he brought with him a big beaver. They skinned and cooked the beaver
for lunch; then Ciŋgibis and his two wives continued their journey. Soon Ciŋgibis
said, “Well, we are not far from the village now. I am going to place my caribou snare.”
He meant rabbit when he said caribou. So he placed his snares. He then told the girls,
“At the village your sister-in-law will come down to see you. Maŋg (Loon) is the name
of the chief of the village. But we won’t camp near them; we’ll camp a little to one
side.” They went down the river until they came to the mouth, and at that point they
saw the wigwams.
</p>
<p>All the people yelled when they saw Ciŋgibis, for he was a great man, although he
was the ugliest one among them. They cried, “Ee Ciŋgibis! He has two wives.” So they
all laughed and the sister of Ciŋgibis came to shake hands with his two wives. Then
Ciŋgibis pitched his wigwam. Soon a man who was a second chief came to Ciŋgibis and
said, “Chief Maŋg wants to see you. He is going to have a dance tonight.” Ciŋgibis
said to his wives, “Stay here and don’t go to the dance. There are too many nice-looking
men there.” On account of this the two wives became angry with him. Ciŋgibis put on
his best clothes and went to the dance.
</p>
<p>By and by the wives heard drumming and fine voices singing. So they decided to go
and peep in at the dancers if Ciŋgibis should not see them. They did this and peeped
in through <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>the bark, and there they saw Loon singing. He was a fine-looking man with a fine voice
and fine clothes. Ciŋgibis was beside Loon, looking exceedingly ugly in contrast to
him. The wives said, “It is a shame that Loon is so good-looking.” They then went
back to camp and put two stumps in the place where they were to sleep, covered them
with blankets and ran off.
</p>
<p>Ciŋgibis came back from the dance and, thinking that he was sleeping with his two
wives, he lay down between the two stumps and fell asleep. But his two wives went
to sleep with Chief Loon. By and by ants began to bite Ciŋgibis and he scolded his
wives, saying, “Don’t do that.” At last he discovered the stumps and threw them out.
At daybreak he went to the chief’s wigwam and there, sleeping with the Chief, he saw
his two wives. “You are a dead man for this!” said Ciŋgibis.
</p>
<p>He then went to his grandmother. “What do you want?” asked she. “I want a chisel and
a flint.” “What do you want with them, grandchild? Are you going to be in mischief
again?” said the grandmother. However, she gave them to him, and Ciŋgibis tied two
flints to his feet and placed the chisel in the fire to make it red hot. Then he asked
for some eagle feathers (but this was a <i lang="oj">wiske·djak</i> (Canadian Jay) feather). He got them and placed them on his head. When the ice chisel
became red hot, the old grandmother said, “Say, Ciŋgibis, don’t do any mischief again,”
but Ciŋgibis picked up the chisel and ran away with it to the wigwam of Loon.
</p>
<p>Loon always slept with his mouth open. When Ciŋgibis reached the wigwam, he found
every one in it asleep. He shoved the chisel into Loon’s open mouth, killing him,
ran off to his canoe, jumped into it, and paddled away to his snares. He did this
so that no one would suspect that he had killed their chief. This is the reason why
the Loon always has a black mouth—from where he was burned. Ciŋgibis found a rabbit
in his snare. He placed the blood of the rabbit in some hay and tied the hay to his
stomach.
</p>
<p>When he returned to the camp, the people were mourning for Loon. Ciŋgibis came in
slowly. The second chief said, “Ciŋgibis will be very sorry when he hears that Chief
Loon is dead. He was his great friend. We must tell him before he arrives.” Then the
people called to Ciŋgibis, “Ee Ciŋgibis, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>chief is dead.” “What!” said Ciŋgibis, “the chief is dead!” Then he drew out his knife
and pierced the hay full of rabbit blood. The blood ran out and all the people thought
that he had killed himself. Ciŋgibis then dived into the water and the people came
out in their canoes to look for him. They saw the rabbit blood upon the water and
gave up looking for him. After a few days, they made another chief, Goose (<i lang="oj">nixka′</i>), since both Loon and Ciŋgibis were dead.
</p>
<p>Ten days after this had happened, early in the morning the people heard somebody singing
near the shore three times, “Who killed our chief? I am the one.” They awoke Chief
Goose and he exclaimed, “I was thinking that that Ciŋgibis was in all kinds of mischief.
So we must try to kill him.” Accordingly he sent all the men after him in canoes.
When Ciŋgibis dived, they could only see his feathers which his grandmother had given
him, but they could not catch him. Ciŋgibis said to them, “You are all spirits. Drink
all this water and you will get me.” Then the Ducks and Geese drank all the lake dry
and chased Ciŋgibis among the rocks, and thought that they would catch him. “No, no,”
laughed Ciŋgibis, “I know some more tricks yet.” So he ran about and kicked the rocks
with the flints his grandmother had given him, which were fastened to his feet, and
water began flowing out and finally covered everything. The people who were pursuing
him had to swim for their lives. They all became ducks. This is the origin of all
the ducks. When the people left their canoes, they were obliged to swim and so they
are swimming yet.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(6)</span> <span class="sc">Beaver Gives a Feast.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All the animals, once upon a time, were camped together—the Beaver, the Otter, the
Muskrat, and the others. Their chief was Beaver. Every once in a while he would give
a big feast, build a big wigwam, and invite all the men and women to come in and eat
with him. He would tell them, “Well, I want to give a feast.” Then they would come
in, sit around the inside of his big wigwam and pass the food around from one to the
other. He would provide lots of grease in birch-bark dishes. Now, one time, when he
gave one of his feasts, Beaver cut his grease <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>supply into cakes which he served around to his guests. Every time he passed a cake
to a guest, pepedit. Indeed, every time he moved, pepedit, or when he would go and
cut a new block of grease.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2401src" href="#xd31e2401">25</a> Now every time the Beaver broke wind, the Otter laughed. He did not seem to know
that this would offend the Beaver, because he was a little foolish. The other guests
told the Otter, “You mustn’t laugh when Beaver does that; he is our chief.” Despite
this, every time they went to a feast, <span lang="la">castore pedente</span>, the Otter laughed at him.
</p>
<p>So one time the Beaver sent a man to invite all the people to another feast. He sent
the messages all through the camp. Now the people told the Otter this time, “You must
not come; you never keep your mouth shut; you always laugh. If you only knew enough
to keep still like the rest of us, it would be all right, but you had better stay
home.” “Oh well, all right,” said the Otter, “I’ll stay back.” All went to the feast
except the Otter. But he asked the others, “You will have to bring my share to me,
since I can’t come. Tell the chief to send me my share.” The others agreed and went
to attend the feast; but they asked him, “How big a piece of grease do you want?”
The Otter replied, “Bring me a piece the size of my forearm.<span class="corr" id="xd31e2409" title="Not in source">”</span> (The otter has a very small forearm.) When the guests arrived at the feast, the Beaver
chief saw that the Otter was not with them. Said he, “Where, indeed, is Otter? I like
him because he is so funny.” They informed him that the Otter had not come, but that
he wanted the chief to send him a piece of grease as large as his forearm. The Beaver
cut a piece that size and sent it to the Otter; that is all the Otter got. He did
not get very much because he had such a short forearm. That is the end of my story.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(7)</span> <span class="sc">Tcaka·bįs.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tcaka·bįs lived with his grandmother. One time he made a long journey and was away
for quite a while. He came to where there were some giant women who were scraping
frozen beaver skins, “<i lang="oj">kąc, kąc</i>.” He returned home and told his grandmother, “I heard the giant women scraping beaver
hides.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>“Don’t go near them,” said his grandmother. And she repeated this warning often to
Tcaka·bįs.
</p>
<p>However, one day he returned to where he had heard the giant women, and when he reached
the lake, there they were, chasing beaver on the ice. When he came up, they knew him
and cried out, “Ee, come on, come on, Tcaka·bįs!” So he went over to them and they
said, “There is a beaver here and you must pull him up.” Tcaka·bįs was small and they
thought the beaver would pull him through the hole into the ice. But he caught hold
of the beaver’s tail and pulled him through all right. Then they asked him to stay
with them, but he went away after he had stolen the big beaver tail, six feet long,
and went back to his grandmother. When he got home, he showed her the tail, and she
asked, “Did you steal it?” “No, no,” answered he. Then he made a door for their wigwam
out of the tail.
</p>
<p>Soon the giant woman came to where he lived and called. “Tcaka·bįs, you are a dead
man!” They came for the purpose of eating Tcaka·bįs and his grandmother. Then the
grandmother said, “I told you not to go there. Now they say you are a dead man.” But
Tcaka·bįs said, “Don’t be afraid, grandmother. I will take care of you.” Then he took
his witch stone<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2428src" href="#xd31e2428">26</a> and threw it up inside the wigwam, and the whole wigwam turned to stone except a
little hole in the top for the smoke to come through. The stone was so thick that
they were unable to hear the giant women pounding on the outside. Then the giant women
went away and Tcaka·bįs lay inside of the wigwam in safety. But he felt a little sick,
because he had eaten too much beaver fat.
</p>
<p>Some time after this, Tcaka·bįs went back again to the giant women and found them
pounding up and boiling moose bones to make soup. As he came up, one of the giant
women seized him and threw him into the pot. There he stayed for a long time, boiling
and circling round and round in the pot, but still he was alive. At last, when the
giant women needed grease, they dipped up Tcaka·bįs with a wooden spoon and threw
him outside. Then Tcaka·bįs went back to his grandmother. He was very thin, because
he had been boiled so long, nothing but skin and bones. That’s the end; he was a small
fellow.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Aniwɔ·ye was the monster Skunk. He used to travel all over this world, trying to find
the Ojibwa. He hunted them to kill them. He often took the form of a man. Whenever
he would encounter people, he would approach them et pepedit towards their camp with
his back to them, killing the people <span lang="la">malo ejus odore</span>. In those days there was no other sickness. That was the only sickness which people
had to kill them.
</p>
<p>Once upon a time in a camp where there were lots of people, hunters of a big band,
they beheld the tracks of Aniwɔ·ye near one of their trails. It was winter time. When
they saw these tracks, they turned back from their object because they were afraid
Aniwɔ·ye would see their own tracks and follow them to camp and kill all their people.
On this account they started off in every direction in order to lead Aniwɔ·ye away
from the camp and so save their own people and possibly themselves. Said they, “We
will go to Big Fisher lake, where the Big Fisher lives.” So they started off. But
there was one old woman who could hardly see. She could not travel with them, so they
had to leave her, as nobody could carry her.
</p>
<p>Soon Aniwɔ·ye found their trails and followed them, and soon he came to the wigwam
in which the people had left the old woman. He looked in the door and saw her sitting
near the fire. “Where are all your people?” he asked her. “They have gone away,” she
answered. “They saw Aniwɔ·ye’s track and departed. But I am too old. I can’t see,
I can’t walk; so they left me here.” This poor old woman thought it was a young man
who spoke to her; she did not know, indeed, that it was Aniwɔ·ye himself. Then Aniwɔ·ye
spoke, “If you can’t walk, I can cure you, so that you will be as well and strong
as you ever were.” So he turned his back to her et pepedit. He blew the wigwam and
the old woman all to pieces.
</p>
<p>Then Aniwɔ·ye followed on the trail of the people. When he had tracked them to Big
Fisher lake, he could see right across the lake, because there was no island in the
way, and there, on the other side, he saw where Big Fisher lived. The people had arrived
here after a hard trip and begged Big Fisher for <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>protection from Aniwɔ·ye. So fast had they travelled that some of the old people,
unable to keep up with the younger ones, had died of their efforts to hurry. Those
who had reached Big Fisher’s camp kept watching for Aniwɔ·ye to appear across the
lake on their tracks. At last they saw him emerge on the lake and come towards them.
All the way along this pursuit, when he had found the people who had died on the march,
he pulled at them to see if they were dead. Now, when Aniwɔ·ye appeared Big Fisher
said to the people, “We will go to meet him. You men go ahead and I will hide behind
you. So we will approach him until we get almost within his range. Do not let him
see me, <span lang="la">sed cum anum suum nobis verteret</span>, spread apart and let me pass you to the front. While his back is turned to us, we
will fix him.” They did as they were told, and the band started forward to meet Aniwɔ·ye,
who also approached them slowly.
</p>
<p>When they were near enough <span lang="la">ut odore ejus attingerentur</span>, Aniwɔ·ye turned slowly. When his back was toward them, <span lang="la">et cum pediturus esset</span>, they opened ranks and Big Fisher ran forth <span lang="la">et prius anum Aniwɔ·yei cepit quam hie pedere posset</span>. He pinched <span lang="la">anum ejus dure</span>. “Ayu!” exclaimed Aniwɔ·ye. “Ayu, ayu! Let go of me! <span lang="la">Non iterum pedam!</span>” But Big Fisher held on and would not let go. They struggled for some time, but Big
Fisher held fast, and at last Aniwɔ·ye died because he could not discharge. He died
and they were all exceedingly glad, rejoicing that he was done for. So they cut him
up into small bits and scattered the bits all about. Immediately these turned into
little skunks which ran off into the bush. That was the end of Aniwɔ·ye, the Monster
Skunk, but there are plenty of small skunks now.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">(9)</span> <span class="sc">The Man Who Transformed a Doll into a Woman and Followed Her into the World Above.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a man. He was hunting. He had his own wigwam, where he lived with an
old man and an old woman who called him grandchild. He did not even know his father
and mother. He had never seen young people, so when he became about twenty years old,
he began to think that he ought to get himself a wife. So he started out and travelled
all over, <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>but could not find one. At last, one day, he took a piece of wood and tried to carve
for himself a big doll. He worked hard and after a while he made it so nearly perfect
that it could speak a little. It was a female, but it did not seem to be complete
quite yet.
</p>
<p>Said the doll to him, “Put me in your wigwam, cover me up, and do not look at me for
three days. Be sure not to look, because if you do, I won’t be here.”
</p>
<p>“All right,” said he; and placed his doll in his wigwam. To remove himself from the
temptation of breaking her rule he went away by himself and stayed the first night.
The next afternoon he came back and began wondering to himself. “If I sleep here,”
thought he, “I might, indeed, be tempted to look.” The more he pondered, the more
he weakened. At last, he decided to take a little look. He peeped inside the wigwam
and saw a very nice-looking young girl seated there. Then, gaining control of himself,
he hurried away and camped again that night alone. The third day he came back again
to look at his wife. When he came near the camp, he went to the water-hole.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2494src" href="#xd31e2494">28</a> There he saw a woman’s track going away from the water-hole. Thought he to himself,
“Alas! my wife has gone.” He walked up to the wigwam, looked in, and found that the
woman had actually gone.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2497src" href="#xd31e2497">29</a>
</p>
<p>He now decided to follow her. He went to the woods, cut a piece of cedar, and made
himself a bow and a lot of arrows. The next day he started—this was two days after
the woman had left. Then he walked very fast, starting early in the morning. Soon
he came to a small lake lying still and frozen. When he reached the edge of the ice,
he shot an arrow across, then he sped so fast that he reached the other side of the
lake before the arrow got there. Before noon-time he came to where a camp was located,
and going up to it, beheld an old woman cooking there. “Oh, my grandchild,” said she,
“don’t stand there looking in the door. Come in and eat.” So he went in. Then he asked
her whether she had seen a woman pass there. She answered, “Yesterday, about noon.”
And the old woman gave him a mess of corn and said, “My dear grandchild, it is very
hard <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>where you are going. Many people have tried to go where your road leads; but they
have never gotten there, for many creatures are seeking their lives. But I will help
you.” Then she gave him a leg-bone of a lynx. “When you are in trouble, you may need
this,” she told him. Then he started on, following the tracks of his woman. Every
time he came to a lake, he shot an arrow across and sped before it as he had done
at first. He was fast indeed.
</p>
<p>Soon he came to another wigwam and peeped into this as he had done into the first.
An old woman who was cooking inside spoke to him, as had the first, and invited him
to come in and eat. Then he asked her when she had seen the woman pass by. “A little
after noon time,” she replied. Now, by this, he knew that he had not gained very much.
As before, he ate a little snack of corn and the old woman said to him, “Where you
are going will be a very hard trip for you. Many people try it, but never succeed.
They die.” And she, too, gave him a lynx bone and told him, as the other had done,
that it would help him in time of need on his journey; and he started on again, doing
the same at every lake, until it began to grow late in the day. He had been going
so fast that he felt very tired.
</p>
<p>By and by he came to another camp and peeped in, as before, asked the same question,
and was received in the same way. After he had eaten here, the old woman gave him
a squirrel’s tail to help him overcome the dangers which she warned him against. Said
she, “From now on you won’t see any more camps. Walk very fast now. Soon you will
see a big tree with a square trunk, which will reach very far up into the sky. Now
you won’t see any trail, but look carefully around. That is where your wife climbed
up. There are, indeed, steps cut into the trunk, but you will not be able to see them.
To you it will look smooth.”
</p>
<p>So he proceeded on his way and soon came to the place she had spoken about. There
was the big tree, but no tracks were in sight. Around the base he saw lots of bones,
bones of people who had tried to climb but had fallen down and died. He was bewildered.
Then suddenly he recollected the bones the old women had given him. Taking one in
each hand, like a pick, he began climbing up the great tree. At last he ascended so
<span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>high that the bones began to wear away. When they were so short that he could hardly
use them, he looked down. He had gone so high that he could neither see the world
beneath nor the end of the tree in the sky above. Now his bones were too short to
help him, but he had his bow on his back. He could hardly hold on any longer, so he
cried and yelled for help, but nobody could hear him. Soon he heard a spirit nearby
which murmured to him, “Close your eyes and look through the tree. You will see steps
to climb on.” Then he did as the voice said and perceived steps. He placed his feet
in them and started running up. But now he made another mistake, he did not keep his
eyes closed. When he looked, lo! he found himself back to where he had begun to climb
the steps, holding on with his worn-out bones. Then he bethought himself of the squirrel’s
tail, and at the same moment found himself transformed into a squirrel. He found that
he could run up the great tree by tapping his tail on the trunk at each step. At last
he came to a hole in the sky, in the middle of which the great tree protruded. A wide
space, however, surrounded the tree, separating it from the edge of the sky. It would
be necessary for him to jump across from the trunk to this edge. He made a great effort
and sprang for the edge, but he just managed to catch on at the line of his waist;
his upper parts, which reached above the edge, at once became human; his lower parts,
extending below the edge, remained in the form of the squirrel.
</p>
<p>Then he beheld his wife coming across the surface of this upper world toward him.
Said she, “You should not have come here, because, after all your trouble, you will
die anyway.” She took hold of him and made shift to raise him. Then she pulled him
out after teasing him a little while. “Now,” she said to him, “we always play ball
up here. There are men here whom you will meet. They are your brothers-in-law. They
will want you to play ball. If they beat you in the game, they will kill you; but
if you beat them, you will survive.”
</p>
<p>Then she led him away to a village, where they saw a lot of great White Bears. This
was the great White Bear’s home and his family. Now the old Bear arranged a contest
for the stranger. Said he, “You take this ball and go around the edge of this world,
running. One of these Bears will race with you, <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>to see who gets back here first.” So they started. The Bear took the ball in his mouth
and, as soon as he started running, the man jumped upon his back and shook his ears,
which made the Bear drop the ball. Then he threw the ball ahead. In this way, repeating
the trick, they went around the world, and the man succeeded in getting back first.
When he reached the starting point, the Bears said, “You seem to be a pretty good
man; but there are still more tricks for you to perform. If you win, you can stay.”
</p>
<p>And they all went out together and came to a big rock. One of the White Bears tried
to move this rock, and with a great effort he succeeded in moving it a little. “Now,
you try,” said they, “and if you can’t move it, you are a dead man.” Then the man
took his bow and arrow and shot it at the rock. The rock immediately broke into fragments.
“Indeed, you are a great man, our brother-in-law, and can stay here and hunt and live
with us,” said the old White Bear. Then the old Bear told him, after a while, that
he had better go and hunt, or he would grow lonesome in his new life. By this time
they had grown to like him very much<span class="corr" id="xd31e2517" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>One afternoon, late, he started off to hunt. Everything that he met seemed strange
to him in this new world. Soon he came to a lake with a little ice on it, and when
he walked out he beheld tracks of some animal. Soon he came to a place where a big
wooden mallet lay on the ice. He thought to himself that somebody had lost this mallet.
Then he took it by the handle and hammered on the ice. Immediately the hammer fell
through. Up from the hole in the ice a red otter emerged. He killed the red otter.
Then he went on with the hammer to another place. There he tried again, and this time
got a blue otter. He tried again at another place and got a black otter, which was
like the otters of this world. So, taking his load of otters, he went home to display
what he thought was a pretty good hunt. He carried his game in a bag of leather. When
he got to his wigwam, he shoved his bag in the entrance ahead of him, so that his
wife could open it and see what he had brought.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2522src" href="#xd31e2522">30</a> Thought she to herself, when she saw the game-bag, <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>“I wonder if he will show himself to be a good hunter.” She saw some blood on the
bag. Opening it, she beheld the otters, Now the man had made a mistake, for these
were tame otters and belonged to the Bears. She went out crying to her people, “This
man has killed our otters!” When the old White Bear heard about the news, he said
to his family, “We should have told this man about our otters, because he didn’t know.
On this account it is all right.” He said no more, because he was afraid of the magic
possessed by his new son-in-law.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ayas·e family was a large family. They lived in a camp. Very often they used to
go picking berries, for their country was a rocky country where berries abounded.
Very often some of the berry-pickers would get lost and never be found again. It was
thought that some creature made a prey of them and ate them.
</p>
<p>One time one of the Ayas·e men was travelling. On his way he came across a kind of
cabin of rock, from the top of which smoke was rising and in front of which a number
of human skulls hung in the opening. Now this Ayas·e managed to enter. By being very
careful and not touching the skulls, he gained the inside of the rock house without
making any noise. These skulls were put there to rattle when anybody tried to pass.
When Ayas·e got inside, he beheld two old blind women. As soon as they became aware
of his presence, one of them said, “We had better begin to cook something and we will
find out if Ayas·e is passing here.” Now these old women had some grease in a bark
dish and one of them put some of the grease in a cooking pail. When she did this,
Ayas·e pulled it out with his hand and ate it. Then she took the spoon to taste her
grease, but found it gone. So she put another lump in the dish. Ayas·e took this,
and when she started to dip it up, it, too, was gone. This happened three or four
times. At last the old woman said, “Ayas·e must have passed; somebody told us that
Ayas·e was going to pass. He must have passed now.” Then she took a stick which she
used to poke the fire with and began feeling all around, poking in the corners of
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>wigwam to find if Ayas·e were there. Every time she came near poking him, he moved
to another part of the wigwam, so she could not reach him. Pretty soon she touched
him with the poker and then he took off his coat of fisher-skin which he was wearing
and threw in into the door-way. The old women jumped up and when they felt the fur
coat they thought it was Ayas·e trying to escape through the door. Now these old women
had a sharp pointed bone at each elbow. With this pointed bone they began stabbing
the fur coat in their haste to kill Ayas·e, and pretty soon in their blind fury they
fell to stabbing each other, each one thinking she was stabbing Ayas·e. They killed
each other. One of the old women said before she died, “I believe you hit me by mistake.”
It was too late; they both died.
</p>
<p>Now Ayas·e in the wigwam sat down and looked at them a long time. Then he dragged
them outside and looked at them a long time. All around the wigwam he saw the men’s
and women’s bones, the bones of the victims of these two old blind women. Then he
knew that all of his lost people had been killed by the old women and eaten. They
were cannibals in the shape of monster bats, large enough to kill and eat people.
Then Ayas·e took their bodies and cut them up into small pieces. These he threw into
the air and they sailed off, transformed into small bats as we see them to-day. I
did not see any more.

<p class="first">The Fisher (<i lang="la">mustela pennanti</i>) was living somewhere in this world. Nobody knows where. Now in those times they
had no summer. It was winter, winter all the time. They knew that summer existed somewhere,
but it never came to them, although they wanted it very much.
</p>
<p>Now, once upon a time a man captured some little birds which are called <i lang="oj">ni·bənis·e</i> “summer (guardian) birds.” He tied them in bundles and kept them with him all the
time. That was the reason why it was continually winter, for so long as he held these
birds, they could not bring summer to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>North Country. The people pondered very much how to go about freeing these birds from
the creature who kept them. At last somebody discovered where this creature lived,
and they decided that some one would go and try to free the Summer-birds. Now the
Fresh-water Herring lived in the same wigwam with the man who kept the Summer-birds.
</p>
<p>The Fisher at last decided to go and free the birds, so that summer would come. He
travelled a long while and reached the wigwam where the captor and the Herring lived.
When he went in, he found the Herring alone. He captured the Herring and put some
pitch on his mouth, so that he could not cry out. Then Fisher took the bundles of
birds and tried to break the bindings, so that he could free them. Using his teeth
at last he tore open the bundles and the Summer-birds flew free into the air. Then
the pitch broke from the Herring’s mouth and he cried out, “Fisher breaks the bundle!
The Summer-birds! Fisher breaks the bundles with his teeth! The Summer-birds!” Two
or three times he cried out, until their captor heard him. Then he came up running,
but when he arrived, the Fisher and the Summer-birds were already far away.
</p>
<p>The Fisher ran very fast to save himself. His pursuer had a bow and arrow with which
he was going to kill him, but the Fisher sprang into the sky and climbed way up, with
the hunter following behind him, still trying to shoot him with his bow and arrow.
All he succeeded in shooting, however, was his tail, which is broken where it was
wounded.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2567src" href="#xd31e2567">32</a> Although they chased him continually, they never got him.

The grandfather of these died. Then the father and mother died, and left the children

else.
</p>
<p>So these two boys used to play around, shooting bows and arrows for fun, just as the
Ojibwa boys do now. They used to play near a lake. Then their grandmother would say
to them, “Don’t swim in that lake. There is a big pike in there and he might swallow
you.” The older boy believed his grandmother, but the younger did not. So one day,
while they were playing, the younger boy by mistake shot his arrow out in the lake.
He could see it floating on the surface, so he took off his clothes to swim to it.
But his brother said, “You know what grandmother told you. The big pike might swallow
you.” But the boy started to swim nevertheless, saying, “<i lang="oj">Koga′miko</i>” (“swallowed in the water”) with each stroke that his arms took. When he called this
out, the big pike came and swallowed him.

cried and would not look toward the lake where her grandson had died. But soon she
went along in the canoe, crying, and pulled in the line. At the end was a very large
fish, and they could see that his stomach was full of something. He was so large that
they could scarcely pull him into the canoe. However, they managed to get him in and
then they paddled to the shore and dragged the fish to a place where they could conveniently
clean it. They cut his belly, which was distended, and out jumped the younger brother.

very hungry. Lynx beat his wives because they couldn’t find the beaver. He said to
them, “If you don’t get some beaver for me, I’ll eat both of you.” At this they became
very much frightened. So Rabbit went to a beaver place, and putting a stick in the
hole, she felt a beaver in it. Then Rabbit went home and told Marten, and they both
were glad to get a beaver and save their lives. Then they both went back to the hole.
While Rabbit was pulling the beaver out of the hole and had hold of his hind quarters,
Lynx came along and tickled Rabbit, so that she let go and the beaver escaped. Lynx
was bent on mischief. He said, “If you don’t get some beaver, I’ll kill you tonight.”

<p>Rabbit and Marten went home and burrowed a tunnel in the snow, inside the wigwam.

So he began to pull up <span lang="la">testes suos in se</span> and then he began dancing.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2641src" href="#xd31e2641">36</a> He said to himself, “When they hear this funny thing, they will laugh.” Pretty soon
Marten laughed, and Lynx, digging her out of the hole, killed and ate her. Soon he
grew hungry and tried the same trick. But Rabbit was very much afraid and would not
laugh. Lynx kept on doing this for some time and finally gave it up. He sat near the
fire and cut his belly open, taking out some of his intestines which he roasted and
ate. At last, when he had eaten all his intestines, he came to his heart. When he

“Kwe, kwe,” Lynx asked Rabbit, “where are you going?” Rabbit answered, “I am going

sitting there, reading. He asked Rabbit, “Has anybody <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>been passing here lately Hee!” Rabbit made no answer. Lynx asked this question twice

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were a number of people camping, and one man was camping by himself. He was
a young man and he tried to get <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>his neighbour’s daughter to marry him, but she wouldn’t have him, saying that he was
not good enough. And so the young man went back and forth trying to get a wife.
</p>
<p>Then the people went away to another place to camp, as it was getting spring, but
the young man stayed back. He was full of <i lang="oj">mite·′win</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2714src" href="#xd31e2714">37</a> He planned to have revenge upon the girl who would not have him. He collected <span lang="la">omne excrementum quod invenire potuit</span> and made it into the shape of a man. He was determined to settle with the girls who
had refused him, for he was full of revenge. When he had made the man alive, he sent
him to where the girls were camping. The new creature was frozen nice and hard, he
was nice-looking, and he could talk.
</p>
<p>And so <span lang="la">Homo excrementi</span> came, early in the morning, crunching through the snow to where the girls were in
camp. When they saw him coming, they cried, “Somebody’s coming. Make a fire.” And
when he reached the camp every one received him in fine style, as he was such a nice
fellow. “Where do you come from? Who is your father?” they asked him. “Hump-back,”
said he. “Who is your mother?” “Flat-set <span lang="la">excrementum</span>,” answered he. But the old people did not understand him. He was unable to stay near
the fire long, for fear he would melt. They wished him to stay at the camp, but he
couldn’t, so he hurried away.
</p>
<p>Then one of the girls who had refused the young man in marriage followed him and he
led her a long chase. She began to feel it grow warmer (it was April) and soon she
found one of his mittens and later his hat. At last it became so warm that she came
to the place where he had melted altogether <span lang="la">et ibi erat agger excrementi</span>. When she examined the hat, <span lang="la">internum ejus excrementi illitum invenit</span>. So she went back home saying, “Good for him, he’s melted. I’m glad he is melted.”
She couldn’t catch him anyway, so she was angry.
</p>
<p>So young girls should not try always to get a nice-looking man, but take the man selected
for them. The old people tell them this story for a lesson, lest they lose a good
man, though not so handsome, to get a “stinker.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Muskrat, Beaver, Dog, and some Ojibwa were companions and hunters. They were real
people who could talk to one another. They started out one day and came to a small
lake and there they saw Beaver houses and families. It was early in the winter. They
said, “That’s a good lake to drive the beaver, as it’s all rocky and they can’t escape.
The season is right, so we will come tomorrow with dogs.” The Beavers were in their
houses and they saw the Indians, but they couldn’t hear the talking. The Muskrat heard,
however, and went to the Beaver and told them. “You must look out for yourselves,
uncles. Those Indians say you are very easy to catch.” Now the Muskrat had stayed
outside the Indians’ wigwam and listened to what they were saying, until his feet
got so cold that he could stay no longer. So that this was all that he had heard to
tell his uncle the Beaver.
</p>
<p>The next morning the Indians came to the lake and broke the Beaver’s houses, and the
big Beaver told the young ones, “When you see a dog passing, whistle.” So the young
Beavers went to different places under the ice and when they saw a dog <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>passing, they whistled and all were thus caught and killed by the men. But the big
Beaver didn’t whistle, and he escaped. The Indians said, “Where’s the big Beaver?”
Then they went back and had a big feast on those they had caught. In those days people
used to cut a flat bone from the hind foot of the beaver and throw it into the water,
so that the dogs wouldn’t get it. These hunters, however, made a mistake and forgot
to save that bone. They lost it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2766src" href="#xd31e2766">38</a>
</p>
<p>So the Indians had their feast, and when they threw the bones into the water, one
of the little Beavers came back to life and went back to his parents. He said to them,
“I had a fine time, father. They hung me over the fire, and I danced for them.” Shortly
all the Beavers came back, but one of them said, “I’m very sick, father. They didn’t
use me right.” This was the Beaver whose bone from his hind foot the hunters had lost.
He was very sore and disgusted and showed his father the fresh mark of his foot where
the flat bone was lost, when they asked him what was the matter. The Beavers did not
like this and they became angry. So nowadays the Indians tell the young boys neither
to talk about the Beavers, nor the prospects of a hunt before attacking a beaver colony,
lest the Muskrat hear them and tell the Beaver. And also, when the hunting dogs suddenly
go off from camp and run over the ice, the hunters say the dogs hear the beavers whistling.

<p class="first">There was a conjurer (<i lang="oj">mi·te′w</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2844src" href="#xd31e2844">40</a> whose name was Gitcikwe′we (“buzzing noise”), his wife Pi·dje′ʻkwe<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2847src" href="#xd31e2847">41</a> and their children, camping at a lake in a wigwam. There was a large lake to the
west of where they were camping full of islands. It was a long portage from the wigwam
to this lake.
</p>
<p>One evening, while Gitcikwe′we was sitting in his wigwam, he became very much frightened.
He saw nothing in particular that frightened him, but on account of his <i lang="oj">mi·te′w</i> feeling he became afraid and knew that something was coming. At dusk he gathered
up his blankets and jumped into his canoe with his family, and they floated on the
lake beside the camp, all night long. When he went back to the wigwam in the morning,
he found that a Windigo<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2857src" href="#xd31e2857">42</a> had been there and had smashed his wigwam.
</p>
<p>Then the family started to take the portage which led across to the big lake containing
the islands. When Gitcikwe′we took the portage, he sent his wife and children ahead
and told them to hurry on as fast as they could, while he would follow behind with
the canoe. He said, “When you hear ‘Meat bird’ (Wiske·djak<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2862src" href="#xd31e2862">43</a>) flying above you, that means ‘Hurry’, for the Windigo is coming behind to catch
you. That will be your warning.” They reached the other end of the portage and got
into the canoe and paddled out to one of the islands to a place where the end of the
portage, from which they had just come out, was lost to view. They were safe there,
as the Windigo, having no canoe, could not cross. After Gitcikwe′we put up his camp,
he said to his wife, “I am not yet satisfied. I must beat that Windigo, because he
will bother us all winter, and then we will starve, for I cannot hunt while staying
at camp all the time, watching out for you and the children.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he made his <i lang="oj">mi·te′o</i> wigwam with its seven poles and covered it with bark.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2871src" href="#xd31e2871">44</a> He went into it and it began to work and move, while a band of spirits could be heard
singing inside.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2874src" href="#xd31e2874">45</a> Then Windigo came there and Gitcikwe′we said to his wife, “We will clinch him and
take him away out west where he came from.” When he clinched him, the conjuring wigwam
shook and made a noise like thunder, and the children fainted from fright, for they
knew their father was inside. When they recovered consciousness, everything was still
in the wigwam, and their father had gone out west, taking his captive with him. A
little while after this the wigwam started to move again and Gitcikwe′we was back
again from his trip out west. He said to his family, “We will be all right now. I
took him back west. He is very sick from his fright but he will stay there now.”
</p>
<p>There was another <i lang="oj">mi·te′</i> Indian one day’s journey from where Gitcikwe′we was camping. This Indian was so full
of <i lang="oj">mi·te′</i> also that, while he was asleep, he heard Windigo passing overhead with a great moaning
noise as if he were in pain. No other people heard it except this man, because they
were not <i lang="oj">mi·te′</i>.
</p>
<p>Next morning Gitcikwe′we awoke and found that it was a fine day with no wind to bother,
and the whole family was happy to think of passing another winter. Shortly after they
had gotten up, they heard a great noise of shouting in the direction of the end of
the portage from where they had come and which was just lost to view. When Gitcikwe′we
heard this, he loaded his flint lock gun to shoot Windigo, for he thought he had come
back and was making the noise and concluded that that was the only way to get rid
of him. He and his wife got into the canoe for this purpose. When they turned the
point, they saw a young man standing right in the portage. It was Gitcikwe′we’s wife’s
nephew. He had left his canoe at the other end of the portage, as it was so long to
carry it, and he was expecting his aunt to take him across in her canoe. So he got
into the canoe and the three of them returned to camp.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2890src" href="#xd31e2890">46</a>

angry and growls. His plaints, the Indians believe, can be clearly heard when he is
offended. The Ojibwa never go near there when they can avoid it; and they seldom throw
a stone in the lake, splash their paddles, or shoot their guns near its shores.

cut and painted pictures in the rocks on river or lake shores, so that their friends,

them. The characters of these pictures would tell what had happened, so that if the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At that time there were people living, four in number: a woman, a young baby who could
hardly walk, and two sons who were grown-up men. Their father had died and the family
lived together in a wigwam. It was winter and the sons had two rabbit snares’ trails,
one to the east and the other to the north, and they went to different lines on different
days. The mother would attend to the snares and leave the baby, wrapped in a rabbit
skin blanket, alone in the camp, while the two sons <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>would hunt and look around for game, having only bows and arrows.
</p>
<p>When they came home in the evening, they would sometimes bring with them spruce partridge
and other kinds of partridge. Their mother used to bring home partridges also, but
she had no bow or arrows, and the men wondered how she did it, because she often brought
home as many as ten birds. They could not understand how she was able to do better
than they, so they asked her, “What did you do it with?” They never went with their
mother to where she had her snares, but they were continually asking her how she caught
the partridges. She answered, “I cut a pole, put a string there on the end, and catch
them by the neck, since I have no bow.” But they didn’t believe her, as they often
saw arrow wounds in the partridges’ breasts. They looked at these wounds and said,
“Somebody must have shot them for you. Was it not the Iroquois?” “No,” answered the
mother, “I caught them with a pole snare and poked them with a stick in order to bloat
them with blood, so they will make more bouillon.” But still they didn’t believe her
and they said to each other, “Mother doesn’t like to tell us. Some Iroquois, I guess,
are going to kill us. We’ll fool our mother and these Iroquois. When we go to bed,
we’ll sleep with our baby.”
</p>
<p>So that night they said to their mother, “We want to sleep with our brother the baby,
on his side of the wigwam.” They dried their moccasins, put them on, and also put
on rabbit skin blankets, for they were preparing to run out during the night. They
had discovered a place the day before where trees had fallen down and snow had covered
them, thus making a tunnel. So that night they rolled their little brother up in a
blanket and left early in the night, unknown to their mother. When they left, the
Iroquois were getting closer. The mother awoke and cried out, “<i lang="oj">Madja′wαk</i> they are going!” She did this to help the Iroquois find them. The Iroquois followed
them on snowshoes, but the sons made a great number of branch trails in order to deceive
them.
</p>
<p>The three finally reached their windfall tunnel and there they stayed and waited for
the Iroquois. At daylight the Iroquois took up the trail and followed until they finally
reached them. <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>The three in the cave could hear the Iroquois talking above them. One of the Iroquois
dug a hole in the snow above the tunnel and peeped down to see if the three were there.
As one by one the Iroquois looked through the hole, the sons shot them, the arrow
falling back through the hole so that they could use it again. They killed nearly
all of them, and at last no more Iroquois faces appeared above the hole, but the sons
could hear crying. Finally they decided to come out, and one of the sons went out
first to look around, but he could see no one. They then started back to the wigwam,
following the Iroquois tracks, but they only saw two trails. One of the sons went
a little ahead and the other followed behind with the baby.
</p>
<p>When they reached their wigwam, they found it smashed to pieces and the poles flattened
out. Their mother was killed and the Iroquois had cut off her breasts and made babiche
strings<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2945src" href="#xd31e2945">48</a> of it. These two Iroquois who were left had made a tripod of sticks and had wound
the skin all the way around it. Then they had gone and were never seen again. The
mother had agreed with the Iroquois that they were not to kill her if she didn’t tell
her sons of their whereabouts.

<p class="first">A <i>divination device</i> is used before the hunt to foretell what kind of game is going to be killed. It is
as follows. The metacarpal bone of a beaver’s hind leg, with its sinew covering, is
taken and cut nearly through, so that it will break easily.
</p>
<p>This is stuck upright in the ground near the fire and a series of lines radiating
from it are traced in the ashes or ground, each line being named for some game animal:
moose, beaver, caribou, deer, bear, otter, martin, fisher, etc. Then, as the heat
shrinks the sinew, it breaks the bone at the cut and the upper piece points along
one of the lines marked. This answers what kind of game is going to be gotten. The
lines sometimes also are used to denote the direction to be followed to get the animals
designated.
</p>
<p>(A variation of this operation was noted from the Mattagami band. Here a stick is
used instead of a beaver bone and the base of the stick is burned. When this falls,
it denotes the direction to be taken to secure game).

creatures have ugly faces and seek to hide them when they meet with people. A little
narrative of a meeting with these creatures is told by some Timagami Indians who had
been to Lake Timiskaming. The Indians were passing the high ledge of rock a few miles
below Haileybury, where the water was very deep and where they had set their nets.
They found that somebody had been stealing fish. They proceeded to watch the nets
and soon saw three <i lang="oj">Me·′megwe·‵s·i</i> come out astride of an old log for a canoe, using sticks for paddles. The Indians
pursued them, the fairies meanwhile hiding their faces. Finally the Indians caught
one. Then one Indian said, “Look behind!” When the fairy turned quickly they got a
glimpse of how ugly he was. The Indians then took a knife from this fairy and the
rest disappeared, riding their log through the rock wall to the inside, where they
could be heard crying, as this was where they lived. The Indians then threw the knife
at the rock and it went right through to the inside to its owner.

<h2 class="main">Appendix: Notes on Timagami Folk-Lore.</h2>
<p class="byline">(<i>By Neil C. Fergusson.</i>)</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[<i>Note.</i>
</p>
<p>Under date of August 30, 1913, Mr. Neil C. Fergusson, Timagami Fire Ranger, wrote
from Bear island, Lake Timagami: “While at Bear Island I met Mr. Speck, who was gathering
Indian lore and legends for the Victoria Memorial Museum. His work interested me greatly.”
He then proceeds to communicate some folk-lore material which he had himself collected
from Timagami Indians. This, kindly put by Mr. Fergusson at the disposal of the Geological
Survey, is here added as a supplement to Dr. Speck’s own data.
</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">E. Sapir.</span>]
</p>
<p id="app1">(1) <i>Whisky Jack and the Markings on Birch Bark.</i>
</p>
<p>“One Indian told me a few incidents about Whisky Jack (Anglicised form of native Wiske·djak)
and ended by saying that he had seen the outline of that strange personage imprinted
on a rock along the Ottawa river. He said that the markings on the birch bark were
caused by Whisky Jack when he struck the bark, which was once clear, with a balsam
bough and then threw a bird at the tree. Hence the knots give the appearance of a
bird with outstretched wings, as seen on the enclosed piece of bark (see Figure 2).”
</p>
<p id="app2">(2) <i>The Two Girls, Hell-Diver, and Loon.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3131src" href="#xd31e3131">1</a>
</p>
<p>Once upon a time two girls who were out in the woods climbed a tall spruce tree, but
when they wanted to descend, they found that it was impossible. Just then a Moose
passed near the tree <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>and both girls called to him for help. The Moose, however, passed on without aiding
them. Likewise a Deer, an Otter, and a Lynx all went by, but from none did they receive
any help. At last a Wolverine came along and listened to the girls’ entreaties. He
finally climbed the tree and brought the girls safely to the ground, after which all
three walked along together. The girls didn’t wish the Wolverine as a companion, so
one of them said that she had dropped her hair-ribbon near the spruce tree and asked
the unwelcome companion to go back for it, saying that they would wait where they
were until he returned. The kind Wolverine went off on his errand, and, as soon as
he was out of sight, the two girls made their departure. So the Wolverine came back
and saw no girls. He heard a whistle and went in that direction. Then he heard another
whistle behind him, and so on, but still he failed to find the girls, for the trees
were whistling one after another in order to fool the poor Wolverine. The Wolverine
went his own way, feeling very much grieved.
</p>
<p>The girls walked on swiftly until they came to a little wigwam built in the bush.
It was a very pretty wigwam and looked so inviting to the tired girls that they went
inside to rest. Soon a Bird, who was the owner, came along and demanded their business
in his wigwam. They told him that they had lost their way, so he gave them a cup of
tea and directed them on their journey. The girls travelled on and came at last to
a river at the end of which was a lake. A Beaver was paddling his canoe down the stream,
but wouldn’t take the girls in. Next a Loon, who was the king of all water animals,
came along in his canoe, but he also refused to take them with him. Finally a “Hell-diver”
came paddling by. He was very kind and took the two girls down to the lake where he
dwelt and told them that they might sleep in his wigwam that night. He gave them some
blankets and then went out on business.
</p>
<p>The girls, however, couldn’t go to sleep, for they heard music and knew that a dance
must be going on. They got out of their bed and went to the house where they heard
the music. Looking in at the window, they saw the Loon playing the fiddle and all
the dancers enjoying themselves, so they returned to their bed and placed two logs
under the blankets to deceive <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>their kind friend, the “Hell-diver,” into thinking that they were still where he had
left them.
</p>
<p>While the two girls were dancing, the “Hell-diver” returned and lay down under the
blankets, but the logs happened to be partly rotten and were filled with ants, so
that it wasn’t long before he discovered the trick that had been played on him. At
once he went to the Loon’s house, thinking that the girls had been to the dance. All
was dark in the house, as the dancers had left, but he could see that the two girls
and the Loon were lying there asleep. The Loon was snoring with his mouth wide open.
The “Hell-diver” was seized with anger and went swiftly back to his wigwam, where
he heated a piece of iron until it was red hot. He hastened with this to the Loon’s
house and crammed it down the sleeper’s mouth.
</p>
<p>Knowing that he had killed the Loon and that the murder would soon be discovered on
the next day, he made ready to go on a hunting trip and told his old grandmother that
he’d be back on the following evening. When the murdered Loon was discovered, his
murderer was far away in the bush and had already caught one deer in his trap. He
filled a portion of its entrails with blood and hung it around his neck, then started
for home. As his canoe neared the village in the evening, all the people ran down
to the water’s edge and cried, “Our chief is dead!” The “Hell-diver” pulled his knife
and cut the bladder of blood which hung about his neck, upsetting the canoe at the
same time. The people lamented, saying, “We shouldn’t have told the ‘Hell-diver,’
for he has killed himself from grief.”
</p>
<p>But far out in the middle of the lake the “Hell-diver” came swimming to the surface
and called aloud. “It was I who killed our king, the Loon.” Revenge took hold of all
the people and they at once gave chase, but were unable to catch the murderer, and,
as darkness was upon them, they said, “We will build a dam and in the morning, when
the lake is dry, we will catch him.” In the morning the lake was dry and all the villagers
went in pursuit. The chase was a long one and the ‘Hell-diver’ was in the last stages
of fatigue when he ran to the dam and quickly kicked it down. The waters came running
in and all the people were turned into water animals, but became friends with one
another.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
